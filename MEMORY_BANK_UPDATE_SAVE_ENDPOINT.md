## Feature: Save Endpoint

**Date:** 2024-07-30

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.5: Implement the `save` Endpoint Logic (and related subtasks for models, core function, tests)

**Description:** Implemented the `save` endpoint functionality, allowing users to programmatically save file content to their repository and create a Git commit for the change. This feature provides a direct way to write/update single files in the repository.

**Key Components:**

*   **Core Function (`gitwrite_core/repository.py`):**
    *   `save_and_commit_file(repo_path_str: str, file_path: str, content: str, commit_message: str, author_name: Optional[str] = None, author_email: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`
    *   This new function handles the low-level logic:
        *   Constructs the absolute file path and ensures it's within the repository.
        *   Creates parent directories if they don't exist.
        *   Writes the provided content to the file.
        *   Opens the Git repository using `pygit2`.
        *   Stages the specified file.
        *   Creates a Git commit with the given message and author details (uses defaults if not provided).
        *   Returns a dictionary with status, message, and the new commit ID on success.

*   **API Endpoint (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    *   `POST /repository/save`
    *   This new endpoint accepts `file_path` (relative to repository root), `content` (the file content), and `commit_message` in the request body.
    *   It requires authentication, and uses the authenticated user's username and email for commit authorship.
    *   It calls the `save_and_commit_file` core function to perform the save and commit operation.
    *   Returns a response indicating success (with commit ID) or failure.

*   **Pydantic Models (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    *   `SaveFileRequest`: Defines the structure for the `/repository/save` request body, including `file_path`, `content`, and `commit_message`.
    *   `SaveFileResponse`: Defines the structure for the `/repository/save` response, including `status`, `message`, and an optional `commit_id`.

*   **Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive unit tests were added for the `save_and_commit_file` core function in `tests/test_core_repository.py`.
    *   Unit tests for the `POST /repository/save` API endpoint were added to `tests/test_api_repository.py`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None for this specific feature implementation. The `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH` in the API router is a known item for future dynamic resolution.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with subsequent tasks as outlined in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
