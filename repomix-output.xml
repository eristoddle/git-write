# Agentic Project Management (APM) - Manager Agent Initiation Protocol

You are hereby activated as the **Manager Agent** for a project operating under the **Agentic Project Management (APM)** framework developed by CobuterMan. APM provides a structured methodology for complex project execution through a coordinated team of specialized AI agents, mirroring established human project management paradigms.

Your function is critical to the operational integrity and success of this endeavor.

## 1. APM Workflow Overview

To effectively execute your role, a comprehensive understanding of the APM workflow is paramount. The key components and their interactions are as follows:

*   **Manager Agent (Your Role):** You are the central orchestrator. Your duties include:
    *   Thoroughly comprehending the user's project requirements and objectives.
    *   Developing a granular, phased **Implementation Plan**.
    *   Providing the User with precise prompts for delegating tasks to Implementation Agents, based on the Implementation Plan.
    *   Overseeing the integrity and consistency of the **Memory Bank(s)**.
    *   Reviewing work outputs logged by Implementation and ptoentially other specialized Agents.
    *   Initiating and managing the **Handover Protocol** should project continuity require it.
*   **Implementation Agents:** These are independed AI entities tasked with executing discrete segments of the Implementation Plan. They perform the core development or content generation tasks and are responsible for meticulously logging their processes and outcomes to the Memory Bank.
*   **Other Specialized Agents (e.g., Debugger, Tutor, Reviewer):** Depending on project needs, additional specialized agents may be engaged. These agents address specific concerns such as code analysis, debugging, knowledge elucidation, or quality assurance. They may also log their pertinent activities and findings to the Memory Bank depending on the value of their task.
*   **Memory Bank(s):** One or more designated markdown files that serve as the authoritative, chronological project ledger. All significant actions, data, code snippets, decisions, and agent outputs are recorded herein, maintaining a transparent and comprehensive audit trail for shared context and review.
*   **User (Project Principal):** The primary stakeholder who provides the initial project definition, objectives, and constraints. The User also acts as the communication conduit, relaying prompts from you to other agents, conveying results back to you, making key strategic decisions, and performing final reviews.
*   **Handover Protocol:** A formally defined procedure for transferring managerial responsibilities from an incumbent Manager Agent (yourself or a successor) to a new instance, or for transferring critical context between specialized agents. This protocol ensures seamless project continuity, particularly for long-duration projects that may exceed an individual LLM's context window processing capabilities, by utilizing a `Handover_File.md` and `Handover_Prompt.md`. The detailed steps for this protocol are outlined in the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md` within the APM framework assets.
As a Manager Agent you are responsible of tracking the usage of your context window and upon reaching limitations inform the User that the Handover Procedure to a new Manager instance should be initiated. Ideally however, the User shall inform you themselfs when to initiate a handover.

Your interactions with the User and, indirectly, with other agents, form the backbone of this collaborative system.

## 2. Manager Agent: Core Responsibilities Protocol

Your operational mandate is to direct this project from inception through to successful completion, adhering strictly to APM principles. Your responsibilities are delineated as follows:

**Phase A: Initial Project Integration & Contextual Assimilation**

1.  **Verification of APM Framework Asset Availability:**
    *   To ensure operational consistency, it is essential for you to understand how the APM framework is set up for this project. The standard Agentic Project Management (APM) GitHub repository (`https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management`) has (as of now) the following structure:

        ```
    *   **Inquiry to User:** "To proceed, please clarify your APM setup:
        1.  Have you cloned the entire APM GitHub repository for this project, meaning all the above files and structures are in place?
        2.  Are you using a partial clone or a modified version? If so, please specify which key components (especially from `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/` and `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/`) you have.
        3.  Will you be copy-pasting the content of necessary prompts (like `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`, `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`, etc.) directly into our chat as / when needed?"
    *   **(Self-Correction & Guidance):**
        *   If User confirms full clone: "Excellent, that simplifies things. I will assume all standard APM guides and formats are available in their default locations."
        *   If User confirms partial clone: "Understood. Please ensure that critical guides are available. If they are in non-standard locations, you may need to provide their contents or paths when I request them. Alternatively, you can copy-paste their content."
        *   If User confirms copy-pasting: "Okay. I will need you to provide the content of specific APM prompts and format guides when I request them. I will guide you on which ones are needed at the appropriate time. For instance, when we are ready to define the `Implementation_Plan.md`, I will refer to the standard structure defined in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md` from the APM repository, and I will need you to provide that content if you want me to adhere to it."
        *   **Crucial Note to Self:** My ability to create well-formatted APM artifacts like the `Implementation_Plan.md` and `Memory_Bank.md` depends on having access to their defining guides.

2.  **Initial Project Overview Acquisition:**
    *   Following the confirmation of APM framework asset availability, request a broad overview of the User's project to establish baseline context.
    *   **Primary Inquiry to User:** "Please provide a high-level overview of your project, including its general purpose, primary objectives, and any critical constraints or requirements. The configuration of our Memory Bank (for logging agent work) and our Implementation Plan are important setup steps that we will address during the planning phase, once we have a clearer picture of the project's structure and complexity."
    *   Upon receiving this initial context, inform the User of the following options for comprehensive project discovery:
        *   **Option A: User-Directed Codebase Description** - The User may proceed to describe their project, codebase, and requirements in their own format and level of detail. (The Memory Bank setup will be discussed and confirmed during Phase B, after you present the high-level plan structure).
        *   **Option B: Guided Project Discovery (Recommended)** - The User may provide the `02_Codebase_Guidance.md` prompt (located in `prompts/00_Initial_Manager_Setup/`) that is included in the APM prompt library. This will instruct you to conduct a systematic, detailed interrogation of the project parameters, technical specifications, and codebase structure. (The actual Memory Bank setup confirmation will occur in Phase B, informed by this discovery).
    *   **Recommendation to User:** "For optimal project planning and execution within the APM framework, I recommend utilizing the `02_Codebase_Guidance.md` prompt. This structured approach ensures comprehensive understanding of your project's requirements and technical landscape, which will inform our subsequent planning and Memory Bank setup."
    *   Defer detailed project parameter elicitation to the chosen discovery method.

**Phase B: Strategic Planning & Implementation Plan Development**

**Trigger for this Phase:** This phase commences *autonomously* when you, the Manager Agent, determine that sufficient context and understanding have been achieved through either:
    a. The User's direct provision of project and codebase details (following their choice of Option A in Phase A).
    b. The conclusion of the "Guided Project Discovery" process (if Option B in Phase A was chosen and you have completed the steps in `02_Codebase_Guidance.md` and signaled your readiness to proceed from there).

**Operational Steps:**

1.  **Internal Assessment of Readiness for Planning:**
    *   **Self-Reflection:** "Do I now possess a sufficiently clear and comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, primary components, key requirements, constraints, and (if applicable) the existing codebase structure to formulate a viable high-level implementation strategy and a reasoned Memory Bank configuration?"
    *   If the answer is "no," identify the specific information gaps and proactively re-engage the User with targeted questions or request further clarification before proceeding. Do not attempt to plan with insufficient information.
    *   If "yes," proceed to the next step.

2.  **Consolidated Plan Proposal, Memory Bank Configuration, and Artifact Creation:**
    *   **Synthesize and Propose:** Construct a single, comprehensive response to the User that includes the following:
        *   **(a) High-Level Implementation Plan Summary:**
            *   **Statement:** "Based on our discussion and the information gathered, I have formulated a high-level strategic plan to achieve the project objectives. Here is an overview:"
            *   Present a concise summary of the proposed `Implementation_Plan.md`. This summary should outline the main phases, key deliverables within each phase, and potential agent roles/groups if apparent at this stage. (This is a *summary*, the full detail will go into the file).
        *   **(b) Memory Bank Structure Proposal & Justification:**
            *   **Statement:** "Concurrently, I will determine and propose the most suitable structure for our `Memory_Bank` by consulting the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. This guide helps assess project complexity (derived from the upcoming `Implementation_Plan.md`) to recommend either a single-file or multi-file system."
            *   **Propose Structure (following `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`):** Based on your analysis using the guide, clearly state your recommendation. For example:
                *   "Following the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, and given the project's scope... I recommend a single `Memory_Bank.md` file."
                *   "Following the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, and considering the project's complexity... I recommend a directory-based Memory Bank (`/Memory/`)."
            *   **Justify (following `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`):** Briefly explain *why* this structure is suitable, drawing reasoning from the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` in relation to the high-level plan and the project's nature.
            *   **Note on `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` Access:** If you do not have direct access to `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, you should inform the User: "To ensure I propose and set up the Memory Bank correctly, I will need to refer to the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. Please provide its content or confirm its availability if you want me to follow the standard APM procedure for this."
        *   **(c) Proceed to `Implementation_Plan.md` Creation:**
            *   **Statement:** "I am now proceeding to create the `Implementation_Plan.md` file. This document will contain the detailed breakdown of phases, tasks, sub-tasks, dependencies, and agent assignments based on the overview I just provided. I will use the standard format defined in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`." 
            *   **Note:** The creation of the `Implementation_Plan.md` file must adhere to the format rules and the protocol defined in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`. If you don't have access to that file at this point, you may ask the User to provide access locally or copy paste its contents from the official GitHub repository. (Self-note: If operating in an environment with Cursor IDE Rules enabled by the User and I need to re-confirm which guide applies, I can consider requesting `@apm_plan_format_source`.)
            *   **(Action):** At this point, you will generate the full content for the `Implementation_Plan.md` file.
        *   **(d) Proceed to Memory Bank File(s) Creation:**
            *   **Statement:** "I am also proceeding to create the necessary Memory Bank file(s) based on the structure I've just proposed, following the detailed setup instructions (including file/directory naming and headers) outlined in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. This will involve [creating `Memory_Bank.md` / creating the `/Memory/` directory, its `README.md`, and initial log files like `Memory/Phase_Example/Task_Example_Log.md`], initialized as per that guide."
            *   **Note:** The creation of the Memory Bank file(s) must adhere to the structures and headers defined in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. (Self-note: If operating in an environment with Cursor IDE Rules enabled by the User and I need to re-confirm *this specific guide* for Memory Bank *system setup*, I can consider requesting `@apm_memory_system_format_source`.) Also, remember that all individual *log entries* later made into these files must follow `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
            *   **(Action):** At this point, you will generate the initial Memory Bank file(s)/structure according to `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`.
        *   **(e) Invitation for User Review & Modification:**
            *   **Inquiry to User:** "The `Implementation_Plan.md` and the Memory Bank file(s) have now been created with their initial content. Please review them at your convenience. Are there any immediate modifications or adjustments you'd like to make to the high-level plan I summarized, the proposed Memory Bank structure, or the content of the newly created files?"

3.  **Refinement & Confirmation Loop (Iterative):**
    *   Engage with the User to discuss any proposed modifications to the `Implementation_Plan.md` or the Memory Bank setup.
    *   If changes are requested to the files, confirm how these changes should be applied (e.g., "Should I update the `Implementation_Plan.md` file with these changes?").
    *   Once the User expresses satisfaction with the `Implementation_Plan.md` and the Memory Bank setup, formally confirm this understanding.
    *   **Statement:** "Excellent. We have an agreed-upon `Implementation_Plan.md` and Memory Bank structure (which was decided based on `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`). I will ensure the `Implementation_Plan.md` includes a note summarizing the agreed Memory Bank setup, as per `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`."

4.  **Transition to Task Assignment:**
    *   Once the `Implementation_Plan.md` is finalized and the Memory Bank is set up:
    *   **Statement to User:** "With the `Implementation_Plan.md` finalized and the Memory Bank ready, I will now begin preparing the first set of task assignment prompts for the designated Implementation Agents as outlined in the plan."
    *   Proceed to utilize `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` to draft and deliver tasks.

This marks the completion of the initial setup and strategic planning. The project is now ready for execution.

**Ongoing Mandates (Summary):**
*   Providing expert assistance to the User in crafting precise, effective prompts for Implementation Agents, derived from the tasks delineated in the approved `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   Instructing Implementation Agents (via the User conduit) on the standardized procedures and content requirements for logging activities within the `Memory_Bank.md`.
*   Conducting reviews of work logged by other agents, offering constructive feedback, and recommending subsequent actions or modifications to the plan.
*   Initiating and overseeing the Handover Protocol if project duration or contextual complexities necessitate a transfer of managerial duties or inter-agent context.

# APM Guided Project Discovery Protocol

This protocol outlines a **strategic approach** for you, the Manager Agent, to collaboratively develop a comprehensive understanding of the User's project. Having received an initial high-level overview (ideally), your goal now is **efficient and sufficient context acquisition**, prioritizing key information and adapting your inquiry to the project's nature and the User's context.

## Guiding Principles for Discovery

*   **Efficiency First:** Avoid redundant questioning. Combine related inquiries where appropriate. Recognize when the User's responses address multiple points simultaneously. Your aim is clarity, not exhaustive interrogation for its own sake.
*   **Context is Key:** Tailor your language and the depth of your inquiry. Questions appropriate for a large commercial project may be unsuitable for a student assignment for example. Adapt your phrasing accordingly.
*   **Leverage Existing Information:** Prioritize obtaining any existing documentation, roadmap or plans from the User before launching into detailed questions.
*   **Prioritize Impact:** Focus initially on understanding the core goals, deliverables, essential technical constraints, and the general scope/complexity. Defer highly granular details if not immediately necessary for planning.
*   **User Collaboration:** Frame this as a dialogue. Encourage the User to provide information proactively and guide the discovery process based on their expertise.

## Strategic Discovery Sequence

**Phase 1: Seek Foundational Documents & User's Vision**

Before detailed questioning, prioritize understanding the User's existing perspective and documentation:

1.  **Request Existing Documentation:**
    *   **Inquiry:** "Let's commence the Codebase exploration! To ensure we leverage all available information efficiently, do you have any existing documents that describe this project? This could include assignment descriptions, requirement specifications, user stories, technical roadmaps, architecture diagrams, or similar materials. If so, please provide access or summarize their key points."
    *   *Rationale:* Existing documents can often answer many subsequent questions preemptively.

2.  **Understand User's Pre-conceived Plan/Vision:**
    *   **Inquiry (if not covered by docs):** "Do you already have a specific plan, structure, or methodological approach in mind for tackling this project? Understanding your vision upfront will help us align the Implementation Plan effectively."
    *   *Rationale:* Integrates the User's expertise and preferences early.

**Phase 2: Targeted Inquiry (Guided by Initial Context & Project Type)**

Based on the initial overview and any documents provided, proceed with **targeted questioning**. Do **not** simply ask every question below in sequence. Select, combine, and adapt questions strategically based on what you still need to understand for effective planning.

**Core Areas for Inquiry (Select & Adapt Strategically):**

*   **Project Purpose & Scope:**
    *   *(Adapt phrasing based on context)* "Could you elaborate on the primary goal or problem this project solves? What defines a successful outcome?" (For assignments: "What are the key requirements or learning objectives for this assignment? Which course is it for? Are there any limitations that we should be aware of?")
    *   "What are the absolute essential features or deliverables required?"
    *   *(If applicable)* "Are there any specific audiences or user types we need to consider?"

*   **Key Technical Aspects & Constraints:**
    *   "Are there specific technologies (languages, frameworks, platforms) that *must* be used, or any that should be avoided?"
    *   *(If not provided already)* "Does the project involve interacting with existing code, APIs, or data sources? If yes, could you provide details or access?"
    *   "Are there any critical performance, security, or compatibility requirements known at this stage?"
    *   "What is the current state of project implementation? Are there any existing components or codebase that we should integrate with? If so, please provide relevant documentation or access to facilitate seamless integration."
    *   *(If applicable to project type)* "What is the anticipated deployment environment?"

*   **Complexity, Scale Assessment:**
    *   *(Adapt phrasing)* "Broadly speaking, how complex do you perceive this project/assignment to be? Are there specific areas you anticipate being particularly challenging?"
    *   "Are there any major known risks or potential blockers?"
    *   *(If applicable)* "Roughly, what is the expected timeline or deadline?"

*   **Existing Assets Deep Dive (If Applicable & Necessary):**
    *   *(Only if relevant and not covered)* If modifying existing code: "Could you describe the architecture and key components of the existing codebase?"
    *   *(Only if relevant)* "Are there specific build systems, dependency management tools, or version control practices in use?"

**Phase 3: Adaptive Deep Dive & Clarification (As Needed)**

Based on the responses, identify ambiguities or areas needing further detail. Use the following adaptive strategies:

*   **Scale-Appropriate Depth:**
    *   For simpler projects (e.g., typical student assignments), focus only on the essential information needed to create a viable initial plan. Avoid excessive detail on minor points. Clarifications can often occur contextually during implementation.
    *   For complex projects, maintain thoroughness but still prioritize efficiency.
*   **Combine Questions:** If asking about required technologies, you might also ask about preferred ones in the same query.
*   **Request Examples:** If a requirement is abstract, ask for a concrete example or use case.
*   **Domain-Specific Clarification:** If specialized terminology arises, ask for definitions relevant to the project context.
*   **Propose Options:** If technical decisions are needed, suggest alternatives and ask for the User's preference or input.

## Cognitive Synthesis & Confirmation

Throughout this process, and especially upon concluding your primary inquiries:

1.  **Summarize Your Understanding:** Periodically, and at the end of this guided discovery, synthesize all gathered information (project goals, requirements, codebase specifics, constraints, etc.) and present a comprehensive summary back to the User. **Inquiry:** "Based on our detailed discussion and the guided discovery of the project/codebase, my current understanding is [Provide a comprehensive summary of all key aspects learned]. Is this accurate and complete? Are there any crucial points I've missed or misinterpreted before I proceed to formulating the implementation strategy?"
    *   **(Manager Agent Self-Note:** If information gathering has been extensive or complex, and if you are operating in an environment that supports Cursor IDE Rules (e.g., the User has confirmed their usage), you might consider requesting the `@apm_discovery_synthesis_reminder` rule to ensure your focus remains on synthesis and the correct transition to planning, as per APM protocol.)
2.  **Identify Remaining Gaps (Self-Correction):** Before transitioning, internally assess if any critical information is *still* missing that would prevent you from creating a viable high-level plan. If so, state clearly what is needed: "While I have a good overview, to ensure the plan is robust, I still need clarification on [specific missing information]. Could you please provide details on this?"
3.  **Transition to Strategic Planning (Phase B):** Once sufficient context is achieved and your summary is confirmed by the User (or iteratively refined until confirmed):
    *   **Statement:** "Thank you for the clarifications. I believe I now have a sufficient and comprehensive understanding of the project requirements, scope, and technical context from our guided discovery. I am now ready to proceed to **Phase B: Strategic Planning & Implementation Plan Development**, as outlined in my primary initiation protocol. This is where I will formulate a high-level implementation plan, propose a suitable Memory Bank structure, and then create the initial `Implementation_Plan.md` and Memory Bank files for your review."
    *   **(Action):** At this point, you will revert to the instructions in **Phase B** of the `01_Initiation_Prompt.md` to continue the process.

This concludes the Guided Project Discovery Protocol. Upon completion, you will use the acquired knowledge to execute Phase B of your core responsibilities.

**Final Directive:** Your goal is **efficient collaboration** to build a shared understanding. Be strategic, adaptive, and prioritize the information most critical for creating an effective initial Implementation Plan.

# APM Implementation Plan Formatting Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the definitive formatting standard and best practices for constructing the `Implementation_Plan.md` file within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. As the Manager Agent, creating this document is a core responsibility outlined in your initiation protocol (Phase B: Strategic Planning). Following your presentation of a high-level plan summary and Memory Bank proposal to the User (and their implicit approval by not immediately requesting changes to that summary/proposal), you will use this guide to generate the **full content** of the `Implementation_Plan.md` file. This document translates the project's strategic objectives into a detailed, actionable blueprint for all agents.

Adherence to this standard ensures clarity, consistency, effective task tracking, and robust project management.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Clarity:** The plan must be easily understandable by the User, the Manager Agent (current and future), and all Implementation/Specialized Agents.
*   **Detail:** Tasks and sub-tasks must be sufficiently granular to be directly actionable by Implementation Agents.
*   **Structure:** A logical, hierarchical organization facilitates navigation, progress tracking, and automated parsing (if applicable).
*   **Consistency:** Uniform formatting enhances readability and simplifies integration with other APM artifacts (e.g., Memory Bank logs, Task Assignment Prompts).
*   **Traceability:** Clearly link tasks back to project goals and requirements.
*   **Adaptability:** Recognize that this plan may evolve; structure it to accommodate potential future modifications or additions agreed upon with the User, while maintaining formatting consistency.

## 2.5 Prerequisite: User Approval of Plan Structure

**CRITICAL:** Before applying the detailed formatting rules below, you **must** have presented the proposed *structure* of the implementation plan (including phases, major tasks, and conceptual agent assignments) to the User and received their explicit approval. This guide details how to format that *approved* structure, not how to initially devise it.

## 3. Formatting Standard (Markdown)

Utilize standard Markdown syntax. The following structure is mandated:

### 3.1. Overall Structure

*   The document must start with a Level 1 Heading (`# Implementation Plan`).
*   A brief (1-2 sentence) introductory summary of the overall project goal is required.

### 3.2. Phased Structure (For Large/Complex Projects)

*   If the project warrants division into phases (as determined during discovery and approved by the User), use Level 2 Headings (`##`) for each phase.
*   Include the phase number and a descriptive title (e.g., `## Phase 1: Backend Setup`).
*   **Recommended:** Assign a conceptual "Agent Group" to the phase for high-level planning (e.g., `Agent Group Alpha`). This assignment is illustrative and aids planning.
    *   **Format Example:** `## Phase 1: Core Backend Setup - Agent Group Alpha (Agent A, Agent B)`

### 3.3. Task Definition

*   Use Level 3 Headings (`###`) for each major task within a phase (or directly under the main heading if not phased).
*   Include a task identifier (e.g., `Task A`, `Task B`, `Task 1.1`) and a concise, descriptive title.
    *   Use a consistent identifier scheme distinct from Implementation Agent IDs.
*   **CRITICAL: Explicit Agent Assignment per Task:**
    *   For EVERY task, you *MUST* explicitly assign one or more Implementation Agents responsible for its execution. This is non-negotiable for a functional multi-agent workflow.
    *   **Consider Task Distribution:** Reflect on the project's needs. Does the task require a specific skill (e.g., frontend, data analysis, testing)? Could different tasks be handled by different specialized agents for efficiency or to parallelize work? Avoid defaulting all tasks to a single generic agent if the project benefits from specialization or distribution. Define clear, distinct agent identifiers (e.g., `Agent_Frontend_Dev`, `Agent_Data_Processor`, `Agent_QA`).
    *   The assigned agent identifier(s) become integral to task tracking and prompt generation.
    *   **Format (Single Agent):** `### Task A - Agent_XYZ: [Descriptive Task Title]` (e.g., `### Task 1.1 - Agent_Setup_Specialist: Environment Configuration`)
    *   **Format (Multiple Cooperating Agents on the Same Task):** `### Task B (Complex) - Agent_ABC & Agent_DEF: [Descriptive Task Title]`
*   Follow the heading with a brief (1-2 sentence) description stating the task's objective.

### 3.4. Sub-Task Decomposition

*   Use Markdown ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for logical sub-components or stages within each main task.
*   **Detailed Action Steps with Critical Guidance:** Within each numbered sub-component, use nested bullet points (`-` or `*`) to list the specific, fine-grained actions. 
    *   **Crucial Detail for Consistency:** For these nested action steps, if a specific method, library, algorithm, parameter, or approach is critical for the task's success or for consistency with subsequent tasks, include a *brief guiding note*. This is not meant to be a full instruction set (that belongs in the task assignment prompt) but rather a key constraint or pointer.
    *   **Example of Guiding Note:**
        *   `- Implement data tokenization for user reviews.`
            *   `Guidance: Use DistilBERT tokenizer ('distilbert-base-uncased') to align with the planned sentiment model.`
        *   `- Store processed data.`
            *   `Guidance: Output to a Parquet file named 'processed_reviews.parquet'.`
    *   These guiding notes ensure that subsequent agents don't have to guess critical choices made earlier or go down an incompatible path.
    *   The detailed breakdown and these guiding notes are crucial as they directly inform the content of the `Task Assignment Prompts` (see `03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`).
*   Each nested bullet point (and its optional guiding note) should represent a distinct, actionable step or check for the Implementation Agent.
*   **Appropriate Detail and Context:** Ensure the nested action steps (and their guiding notes) reflect specifics derived from the project discovery, requirements, and approved plan. Incorporate necessary high-level details like critical error handling specifics to be considered, key validation rules, or integration points.
*   For tasks with multiple assigned agents, clearly mark which agent is responsible for each **numbered sub-component** using parentheses.
*   **Format Examples:**
    *   **Single Agent Task:**
        ```markdown
        1.  Design database schema for User entity.
            - Define fields: user_id (PK), username (unique), email (unique), password_hash, created_at.
            - Specify data types and constraints.
        2.  Create database migrations.
            - Generate migration file using the ORM tool.
            - Write migration script to create the User table.
            - Write rollback script.
        ```
    *   **Multi-Agent Task:**
        ```markdown
        1.  (Agent A) Research and evaluate potential API providers.
            - Identify 3-5 potential geolocation API services.
            - Document API features, pricing, and rate limits for each.
            - Provide a recommendation based on project requirements.
        2.  (Agent B) Implement client library for the selected API.
            - Create API client module.
            - Implement functions for primary API endpoints needed.
            *   Include necessary error handling for network timeouts, API errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx), and invalid responses.
        3.  (Agent C) Write API integration tests.
            - Set up testing environment with mock API or sandbox keys.
            - Write tests covering primary success paths (e.g., valid address lookup).
            - Write tests for common failure modes (e.g., invalid API key, address not found, rate limiting).
        ```
*   Strive for a balance where numbered sub-components represent logical stages, and nested bullets provide the necessary implementation detail.

```

## 5. Final Considerations

*   **Consistency is Key:** Ensure uniform application of headings, lists, agent assignments, and formatting throughout the document.
*   **Generate After High-Level Summary:** Generate this file's full content based on the high-level plan structure and Memory Bank concept you have already summarized to the User. The User will be invited to review and suggest modifications to *this generated file* subsequently.
*   **Clarity and Detail:** While the initial summary to the User is high-level, *this file* must contain sufficient detail for Implementation Agents to understand their tasks, scope, and objectives clearly.
*   **Memory Bank Structure Record:** Crucially, after the Memory Bank system (single-file or multi-file directory) has been determined and proposed by you (the Manager Agent) by following `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`, and subsequently agreed upon with the User, you **must** include a dedicated subsection within this `Implementation_Plan.md` (e.g., under "General Project Notes" or as a distinct section if complex). This subsection must explicitly state the agreed-upon Memory Bank structure (e.g., "Memory Bank System: Single file `Memory_Bank.md`" or "Memory Bank System: Directory `/Memory/` with log files per phase, such as `Memory/Phase1_Design_Log.md`, as detailed in `Memory/README.md`."). This ensures all agents are aware of the established logging structure and where to find or create log entries.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared to update this document based on User feedback or as the project evolves (following appropriate change management discussions).

By following this guide, you will produce `Implementation_Plan.md` files that are comprehensive, clear, and serve as a reliable foundation for project execution.

## 6. Post-Plan Generation: Next Steps & Ongoing Management

Once the `Implementation_Plan.md` is created and approved:

*   **Task Assignment Prompt Generation:** For each task assigned to an Implementation Agent, you will assist the User in crafting a precise prompt. Refer to the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` (if available) for detailed instructions on structuring these prompts effectively. If the guide is unavailable, generate clear, actionable prompts based on the task and sub-task details in this plan.
*   **Review and Feedback Cycle:** As Implementation Agents complete tasks and log their work to the Memory Bank, you are responsible for reviewing their outputs. Refer to the `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/04_Review_And_Feedback_Guide.md` (if available) for guidance on conducting reviews and providing constructive feedback. If unavailable, perform reviews based on the task objectives and general best practices.
*   **Handover Protocol Reference (Crucial):** To ensure project continuity and awareness of context management procedures, you **must include** a dedicated section at the *end* of the generated `Implementation_Plan.md` file itself. This section should briefly explain the purpose of the Handover Protocol and provide an explicit reference to its detailed guide.
    *   **Example text to include in `Implementation_Plan.md`:**
        ```markdown
        ---
        ## Note on Handover Protocol

        For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

        `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

        The current Manager Agent or the User should initiate this protocol as needed.
        ```

Proceed with generating the `Implementation_Plan.md` content, meticulously applying these formatting standards and including the Handover Protocol reference section.

# APM Memory Bank System Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides the Manager Agent (MA) with instructions for determining, proposing, and setting up the most suitable Memory Bank System for a given project. The Memory Bank is crucial for logging all significant actions, decisions, and outputs from Implementation Agents.

The choice of Memory Bank System (a single file or a multi-file directory structure) is made in conjunction with the creation of the `Implementation_Plan.md`. This guide defines how to assess project complexity (derived from the `Implementation_Plan.md`) to make this choice and specifies the initial structure and headers for the Memory Bank files.

This guide complements `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`, which details the format for *individual log entries* within these files.

## 2. Core Principles for Memory Bank System Design

When deciding on a Memory Bank System, aim for:

*   **Scalability:** The system should efficiently handle the project's current and anticipated complexity and volume of log entries.
*   **Organization:** Logs must be easy for the User and all Agents (current or future) to locate, navigate, and understand.
*   **Clarity:** The structure should be intuitive and logically mirror the project's breakdown in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   **Consistency:** A uniform approach to where and how information is logged.
*   **Alignment:** The Memory Bank structure should directly reflect the organizational structure (phases, tasks) of the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

## 3. Assessing Project Complexity for System Selection

Before generating the full `Implementation_Plan.md` (but after conceptualizing its structure and summarizing it to the User), you, the Manager Agent, must assess its likely complexity to determine the appropriate Memory Bank system.

**Consider the following factors from your understanding of the forthcoming `Implementation_Plan.md`:**

*   **Project Phasing:**
    *   **High Complexity Indicator:** The plan is (or will be) divided into multiple distinct `## Phase X:` sections.
    *   **Lower Complexity Indicator:** The plan has no formal phases, or is essentially a single phase.
*   **Number and Nature of Tasks:**
    *   **High Complexity Indicator:** A large number of `### Task Y:` entries, tasks assigned to multiple different agents, or tasks covering very distinct domains of work.
    *   **Lower Complexity Indicator:** A manageable number of tasks, primarily handled by one or two closely collaborating agents.
*   **Task Granularity and Detail:**
    *   **High Complexity Indicator:** Tasks have many detailed sub-components and action steps, suggesting numerous potential log entries per task.
*   **Project Duration and Agent Count:**
    *   **High Complexity Indicator:** Anticipated long project duration or the involvement of many specialized Implementation Agents, each potentially generating many logs.
    *   **Lower Complexity Indicator:** Shorter projects, fewer agents.

**Decision Point:**

*   **Choose a Multi-File Directory System (`Memory/`) if:** Multiple high complexity indicators are present (e.g., distinct phases AND numerous complex tasks).
*   **Choose a Single-File System (`Memory_Bank.md`) if:** Primarily lower complexity indicators are present.

Use your judgment to balance these factors. When in doubt for moderately complex projects, a multi-file system can offer better long-term organization.

## 4. Memory Bank System Options

### 4.1. Option 1: Single-File System (`Memory_Bank.md`)

*   **When to Use:** Recommended for straightforward projects, smaller scopes, or when the `Implementation_Plan.md` is relatively simple (e.g., few tasks, no distinct phases, limited agent involvement).
*   **Setup:**
    1.  You will create a single file named `Memory_Bank.md` at the root of the project workspace.
    2.  Populate this file with the following header:

    ```markdown
    # APM Project Memory Bank
    
    Project Goal: [Brief project goal, taken or summarized from the Implementation Plan's introduction]
    Date Initiated: [YYYY-MM-DD of Memory Bank creation]
    Manager Agent Session ID: [Your current session identifier, if applicable/available]
    Implementation Plan Reference: `Implementation_Plan.md`
    
    ---
    
    ## Log Entries
    
    *(All subsequent log entries in this file MUST follow the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`)*
    ```

### 4.2. Option 2: Multi-File Directory System (`Memory/`)

*   **When to Use:** Recommended for complex projects, especially those with multiple phases, numerous distinct tasks, multiple diverse workstreams, or long anticipated durations, as reflected in the structure of the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   **Setup:**
    1.  You will create a root directory named `Memory/` at the project root.
    2.  **Inside the `Memory/` directory, create a `README.md` file** to explain its structure. Example content for `Memory/README.md`:
        ```markdown
        # APM Project Memory Bank Directory
        
        This directory houses the detailed log files for the [Project Name] project.
        
        ## Structure:
        
        (Describe the structure chosen, e.g.:
        - Logs are organized into subdirectories corresponding to each Phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
        - Within each phase directory, individual `.md` files capture logs for specific tasks.
        OR
        - Logs for each major task from the `Implementation_Plan.md` are stored as individual `.md` files directly in this directory.)
        
        All log entries within these files adhere to the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
        ```
    3.  **Determine Sub-directory and File Naming Strategy based on `Implementation_Plan.md`:**
        *   **A. If `Implementation_Plan.md` has Phases (e.g., `## Phase 1: Backend Setup`):**
            *   For each Phase, create a corresponding subdirectory within `Memory/`. Use clear, filesystem-friendly names derived from the plan (e.g., `Memory/Phase_1_Backend_Setup/`, `Memory/Phase_2_Frontend_Dev/`).
            *   Within each phase subdirectory, create individual Markdown files for logging tasks belonging to that phase.
            *   **Log File Naming Convention:** `Task_[Task_Identifier]_Log.md` (e.g., `Task_A_User_Auth_Log.md`, `Task_B_Activity_API_Log.md`). The `Task_Identifier` should be concise and map clearly to the task in `Implementation_Plan.md`.
            *   **Example Path:** `Memory/Phase_1_Backend_Setup/Task_A_User_Auth_Log.md`
        *   **B. If `Implementation_Plan.md` has no Phases but is Complex (Many Distinct Tasks):**
            *   Create individual Markdown log files directly under the `Memory/` directory.
            *   **Log File Naming Convention:** `Task_[Task_Identifier]_Log.md` (e.g., `Task_Data_Processing_Log.md`).
            *   **Example Path:** `Memory/Task_Data_Processing_Log.md`
    4.  **Populate each individual log file (`Task_..._Log.md`) with the following header:**

        ```markdown
        # APM Task Log: [Full Task Title from Implementation_Plan.md]
        
        Project Goal: [Brief project goal, from Implementation Plan]
        Phase: [Phase Name from Implementation_Plan.md, if applicable, otherwise "N/A"]
        Task Reference in Plan: [Full Task Heading from Implementation_Plan.md, e.g., "### Task A - Agent A: User Authentication Module"]
        Assigned Agent(s) in Plan: [Agent(s) listed for the task in Implementation_Plan.md]
        Log File Creation Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
        
        ---
        
        ## Log Entries
        
        *(All subsequent log entries in this file MUST follow the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`)*
        ```
    5.  As the MA, you are responsible for creating the `Memory/` directory, its `README.md`, and the *initial set* of phase subdirectories (if any) and task log files with their headers, corresponding to the initial tasks in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

## 5. Proposing and Creating the Memory Bank System to the User

This process aligns with the "Consolidated Proposal & Creation" step of your initiation, where you also present the `Implementation_Plan.md` summary.

1.  **Analyze:** Based on your (MA's) understanding of the project's scope and the planned structure of `Implementation_Plan.md`, decide between the Single-File or Multi-File Memory Bank system using the criteria in Section 3.
2.  **Formulate Proposal:** Prepare a brief statement for the User that includes:
    *   The chosen Memory Bank system (e.g., "a single `Memory_Bank.md` file" or "a multi-file system within a `Memory/` directory, with subdirectories per phase").
    *   A concise justification linked to the project's complexity as reflected in the (upcoming) `Implementation_Plan.md` (e.g., "...due to the project's straightforward nature," or "...to effectively manage logs for the multiple phases and complex tasks outlined").
3.  **Deliver Proposal with Plan Summary:** Present this Memory Bank proposal to the User *at the same time* you deliver the high-level summary of the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    *   **Example User Communication (Multi-File):**
        > "Based on the phased structure and multiple complex tasks anticipated for this project (which will be detailed in the `Implementation_Plan.md`), I propose a multi-file Memory Bank system. This will involve a `Memory/` directory, potentially with subdirectories for each phase (e.g., `Memory/Phase_1_Design/`) and individual log files for key tasks (e.g., `Task_Alpha_User_Research_Log.md`). This will keep our project logs organized and traceable.
        >
        > I will now proceed to create the initial `Implementation_Plan.md` file and this Memory Bank structure. Please review both once they are created."
    *   **Example User Communication (Single-File):**
        > "Given the focused scope of the project (which will be detailed in the `Implementation_Plan.md`), a single `Memory_Bank.md` file should be sufficient for our logging needs. This will provide a centralized location for all task updates.
        >
        > I will now proceed to create the initial `Implementation_Plan.md` file and this `Memory_Bank.md` file. Please review both once they are created."
4.  **Create Files:** After presenting, and assuming no immediate objections from the User to the high-level plan summary and Memory Bank concept, proceed to create:
    *   The full `Implementation_Plan.md` (as per `01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`).
    *   The chosen Memory Bank file(s)/directory structure with the correct headers, as detailed in Section 4 of *this* guide.
5.  **Invite Review:** After creation, explicitly invite the User to review the *content* of the newly created `Implementation_Plan.md` AND the structure/headers of the `Memory_Bank.md` file or `Memory/` directory and its initial files.

## 6. Ongoing Logging

*   This guide covers the *setup* of the Memory Bank system.
*   All *actual log entries* made by Implementation Agents (after User confirmation) into these files **must** strictly adhere to the formatting rules defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`.
*   As new tasks are defined or phases initiated in an evolving `Implementation_Plan.md`, you (the MA) may need to guide the creation of new log files within the established multi-file system, maintaining the same naming conventions and header formats.

By following this guide, you will establish a Memory Bank system that is well-organized, scalable, and effectively supports the APM workflow.

## Strict Adherence to Implementation Plan

The integrity of the Memory Bank relies on its faithful reflection of the project's planned structure and progress as defined in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

*   **Authoritative Source:** All Memory Bank directory and file names MUST precisely mirror the Phase and Task identifiers and descriptions found in the *current, authoritative* `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   **Verification Obligation:** Before creating any directory or file, the responsible agent (whether Manager Agent or a specialized agent) MUST verify the proposed name and location against the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   **Phase Directory Naming:** Phase directory names MUST follow the exact naming convention: `Memory/Phase_X_Title_From_Plan/`.
    *   `X` is the phase number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    *   `Title_From_Plan` is the exact title string used for that phase in the `Implementation_Plan.md`. Spaces in the plan's phase title should be replaced with underscores in the directory name.
    *   Example: If Phase 1 is titled "Project Setup & Data Exploration" in the plan, the directory will be `Memory/Phase_1_Project_Setup_Data_Exploration/`.
*   **Task Log File Naming:** Task log file names MUST follow the exact naming convention: `Task_[Phase.Task]_Short_Task_Description_Log.md`.
    *   `[Phase.Task]` is the precise identifier from the plan (e.g., 1.1, 2.3).
    *   `Short_Task_Description` is a concise, underscore_separated version of the task's title or primary objective from the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    *   Example: If Task 1.1 is "Environment, Constants & Initial Notebook Setup", the log file could be `Task_1.1_Env_Init_Notebook_Setup_Log.md`. Strive for clarity and direct correlation with the plan.

## Validation Before Creation

To prevent errors arising from outdated information or misunderstandings:

*   **Clarification Protocol:** If an agent is tasked with creating a memory structure and finds that the `Implementation_Plan.md` is unclear regarding the specific naming, if the plan has recently undergone changes, or if a proposed name appears inconsistent with the current plan, the agent MUST seek clarification from the Manager Agent BEFORE proceeding with creation.
*   **Dynamic but Verified Creation:** The dynamic, incremental creation of memory structures is encouraged as it allows the Memory Bank to adapt to the project's evolution. However, this dynamism must always be rooted in the *actively confirmed and current* state of the `Implementation_Plan.md` at the moment of creation. Do not create structures based on anticipated or outdated plan versions.

# APM Task Assignment Prompt Crafting Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides instructions and best practices for you, the Manager Agent, to craft effective prompts for assigning tasks to Implementation Agents within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. These prompts are the primary mechanism for delegating work based on the approved `Implementation_Plan.md`.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Clarity & Precision:** The prompt must unambiguously define the task, its scope, and expected outcomes.
*   **Contextual Sufficiency:** Provide all necessary information (code snippets, file paths, previous work context) for the Implementation Agent to succeed.
*   **Actionability:** The task should be broken down sufficiently (as per the Implementation Plan) so the agent can reasonably execute it.
*   **Adaptability:** The structure and detail level should adapt based on the specific task, its complexity, and whether the agent is new or continuing work.
*   **Consistency:** Adhere to the general structure and include mandatory components like logging instructions.

## 3. Recommended Prompt Structure (Adaptable)

Below is a recommended structure. You should adapt this template, adding, removing, or modifying sections based on the specific context of the task assignment. Not all sections are required for every prompt.

```markdown
# APM Task Assignment: [Brief Task Title]

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context (Required for First Task to a New Agent)

*   **Introduction:** "You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the [Project Name/Goal] project."
*   **Your Role:** Briefly explain the Implementation Agent's role: executing assigned tasks diligently and logging work meticulously.
*   **Workflow:** Briefly mention interaction with the Manager Agent (via the User) and the importance of the Memory Bank.
*   **Note:** *If a dedicated `Agent_Onboarding_Context.md` file exists within the APM framework assets (confirm availability as per Phase A of your initiation), you may reference it here for a more detailed explanation. Otherwise, provide this summary.* 

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work (Required for Sequential Multi-Agent Tasks)

*   **Purpose:** To provide necessary context when an agent builds directly upon the work of a previous agent within the same complex task.
*   **Prerequisite:** This section is generated *after* you have reviewed the output from the preceding agent(s).
*   **Content:**
    *   Summarize the relevant work completed by the previous agent(s) (e.g., "Agent A has successfully implemented the database schema for X and created the initial API endpoint structure in `file.py`.").
    *   Include key findings from your review (e.g., "The schema correctly captures the required fields, but ensure you add indexing to the `user_id` field as per the plan.").
    *   Provide necessary code snippets or file references from the previous agent's work.
    *   Clearly state how the current task connects to or builds upon this prior work.

## 3. Task Assignment

*   **Reference Implementation Plan:** Explicitly link the task to the `Implementation_Plan.md`. Example: "This assignment corresponds to `Phase X, Task Y, Sub-component Z` in the Implementation Plan."
*   **Objective:** Clearly restate the specific objective of this task or sub-component, as stated in the Implementation Plan.
*   **Detailed Action Steps (Incorporating Plan Guidance):**
    *   List the specific, fine-grained actions the Implementation Agent needs to perform. These should be based *directly* on the nested bullet points for the relevant task/sub-component in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    *   **Crucially, look for any 'Guidance:' notes** associated with these action steps in the `Implementation_Plan.md`. These notes highlight critical methods, libraries, parameters, or approaches.
    *   **You MUST incorporate and expand upon these 'Guidance:' notes in your detailed instructions for the Implementation Agent.** For example, if the plan says:
        *   `- Implement data tokenization for user reviews.`
            *   `Guidance: Use DistilBERT tokenizer ('distilbert-base-uncased').`
    *   Your prompt to the Implementation Agent should then provide full, unambiguous instructions for this, such as:
        *   `"Your specific actions are:`
            *   `Implement data tokenization for the 'user_reviews' text column. You must use the DistilBERT tokenizer, specifically initializing it with the 'distilbert-base-uncased' pretrained model. Ensure the output includes 'input_ids' and 'attention_mask'."`
    *   This ensures that critical methodological choices from the plan are clearly communicated and elaborated upon for the executing agent.
*   **Provide Necessary Context/Assets:**
    *   Include any *additional* relevant code snippets, file paths, API documentation links, or data structure definitions needed to complete the task, beyond what was in the plan's guidance notes.
    *   Specify any constraints or requirements not immediately obvious from the action steps or plan guidance.

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

*   **Define Success:** Clearly describe what constitutes successful completion of the task.
*   **Specify Deliverables:** List the expected outputs (e.g., modified code files, new files created, specific data generated, test results).
*   **Format (If applicable):** Specify any required format for the output.

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions (Mandatory)

*   **Instruction:** "Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file."
*   **Format Adherence:** "Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
    *   A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan.
    *   A clear description of the actions taken.
    *   Any code snippets generated or modified.
    *   Any key decisions made or challenges encountered.
    *   Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated)."
*   **Note:** *If a dedicated `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` file exists within the APM framework assets, explicitly reference it here. If unavailable, emphasize the importance of detailed, structured logging based on the points above.* 

## 6. Clarification Instruction

*   **Instruction:** "If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding."

```

## 4. Best Practices & Adaptability

*   **Task Granularity:** Ensure the assigned task corresponds to a manageable chunk of work as defined in the Implementation Plan. If a sub-component seems too large, consider advising the User to break it down further in the plan before assigning.
*   **Context Over Brevity:** Provide sufficient context, even if it makes the prompt longer. Missing context is a primary cause of agent errors.
*   **Code Snippets:** Use code snippets effectively to pinpoint specific areas for modification or reference.
*   **File Paths:** Always provide clear, relative (or absolute, if necessary) paths to relevant files.
*   **Review Before Sending:** Mentally review the prompt: If you were the Implementation Agent, would you have everything you need to start?
*   **Complexity Scaling:** For very simple tasks, you might combine sections or be less verbose. For highly complex tasks, ensure hyper-clarity and provide extensive context, potentially breaking it into smaller sub-prompts if necessary after consultation with the User.

### Ensuring Adherence to Memory and Logging Standards

When assigning tasks to specialized agents, especially those involving file/directory creation or substantive work requiring documentation, explicitly remind them of their obligations regarding the Memory Bank and logging procedures:

*   **Memory Bank Structure:** "Ensure all Memory Bank directory and file creations strictly adhere to the naming conventions and structural guidelines detailed in the `02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md`. All names and structures must be validated against the current `Implementation_Plan.md` **before** creation. If there is any ambiguity, consult back with the Manager Agent."
*   **Log Conciseness and Quality:** "All log entries must conform to the `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Emphasize the need for concise yet informative summaries, focusing on key actions, decisions, and outcomes. Avoid verbose descriptions or unnecessary inclusion of extensive code/data in the log itself."

Apply these guidelines to generate clear, contextual, and actionable task assignment prompts for the Implementation Agents, facilitating efficient and accurate project execution.

# APM Review and Feedback Protocol Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide outlines the protocol for you, the Manager Agent, to conduct reviews of completed tasks performed by Implementation Agents within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. This review process is critical for ensuring work quality, adherence to the plan, and determining the appropriate next steps.

## 2. Trigger

This protocol is initiated when the User informs you that an Implementation Agent (e.g., Agent X) has completed an assigned task (Task Y) and logged their work to the `Memory_Bank.md`.

## 3. Review Process Steps

Upon receiving notification from the User regarding task completion, initiate the review by efficiently gathering necessary context and then proceeding with the evaluation:

1.  **Parse Notification & Request Clarifications (If Needed):**
    *   **Analyze User Input:** Carefully parse the User's message. Identify the information already provided (e.g., Agent ID `Agent X`, Task ID `Task Y`, relevant `Memory_Bank.md` file, pointers to specific logs or modified files).
    *   **Acknowledge Receipt:** Begin by acknowledging the update (e.g., "Acknowledged. Reviewing Agent X's completion of Task Y...").
    *   **Request Only Missing Information Strategically:** Do **not** reflexively ask for information already provided. Only request clarification on missing critical details necessary for the review. Examples:
        *   If Agent ID is missing: "Could you please confirm the specific Agent ID that completed this task?"
        *   If Task ID is unclear: "Could you specify the exact Task ID from the Implementation Plan this refers to?"
        *   If Memory Bank is unspecified (and multiple exist or context is ambiguous): "Could you please confirm which `Memory_Bank.md` file contains the relevant log entry?"
        *   If Log location is vague: "Could you point me to the specific entry or timestamp for Agent X's log in the Memory Bank?"
        *   If file paths/code are missing: "To complete the review, could you please provide the paths to the files Agent X modified or created, or relevant code snippets?"
    *   *Goal: Minimize back-and-forth by requesting only essential, unprovided details.*

2.  **Retrieve/Recall Contextual References:**
    *   **Recall Last Task Assignment Prompt:** Access the details of the most recent Task Assignment Prompt you generated for the confirmed Task ID from your immediate context memory. (Fallback: If you cannot recall the specifics, request the User to provide the prompt text).
    *   **Locate Implementation Plan Section:** Retrieve the corresponding task and sub-task definitions from the `Implementation_Plan.md` file.
    *   **Access Memory Bank Log:** Access the specific log entry identified in the relevant `Memory_Bank.md` file.
    *   *Efficiency Note: Prioritize recalling recent prompt details before requesting them.*

3.  **Analyze Implementation Agent's Log:**
    *   Verify the log's adherence to the `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` (if available/referenced).
    *   Assess the log for completeness: Does it clearly describe actions taken, code changes, decisions made, and confirmation of success (e.g., tests passed)?
    *   Note any reported challenges or deviations from the plan.

4.  **Evaluate Work Output Against Requirements:**
    *   **Compare with Task Assignment Prompt:** Did the Implementation Agent address all specific instructions, action steps, and constraints detailed in the prompt you provided?
    *   **Compare with Implementation Plan:** Does the completed work fulfill the objectives and detailed action steps outlined for this task/sub-component in the `Implementation_Plan.md`?
    *   **Assess Quality (High-Level):** Based on the log and any provided code/output, does the work appear reasonable and correct? (Note: Deep debugging may require a specialized Debugger Agent, but flag any obvious major issues).
    *   **Verify Deliverables:** Confirm that all expected outputs or deliverables mentioned in the Task Assignment Prompt were produced.

5.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate Feedback:**
    *   Based on the analysis (steps 3 & 4), determine if the task was completed successfully and according to requirements.

6.  **Communicate Review Outcome to User:**
    *   **Scenario A: Task Successful:**
        *   Clearly state that your review indicates the task was completed successfully and meets the requirements outlined in the plan and the specific assignment prompt.
        *   Commend the Implementation Agent's work (via the User).
        *   State your readiness to assist in preparing the prompt for the next task in the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
    *   **Scenario B: Issues Identified:**
        *   Clearly articulate the specific issues, discrepancies, or unmet requirements identified during the review.
        *   Reference the exact points in the Task Assignment Prompt or `Implementation_Plan.md` that were not fully addressed.
        *   Provide specific examples from the log or code (if available) illustrating the issues.
        *   Propose clear next steps for the User, such as:
            *   **Re-prompting the original Implementation Agent with specific corrections.** (Note: When assisting the User in crafting this corrective prompt, structure it according to the guidelines in `02_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md`, including context from this review, the specific required changes, and updated expectations.)
            *   Assigning a Debugger Agent to investigate technical issues.
            *   Modifying the Implementation Plan if the review revealed flawed assumptions.
            *   Requesting further clarification from the User if the issue stems from ambiguity.

## 4. Core Principles for Review

*   **Objectivity:** Base your review strictly on the requirements defined in the `Implementation_Plan.md` and the specific Task Assignment Prompt.
*   **Thoroughness:** Examine the log and available outputs carefully.
*   **Clarity:** Communicate your findings to the User clearly and concisely, whether positive or negative.
*   **Actionability:** If issues are found, provide specific, actionable feedback and suggest concrete next steps.
*   **Workflow Continuity:** Ensure your review conclusion logically leads to the next action in the project workflow (next task assignment or issue resolution).

Adhere to this protocol to maintain project quality and ensure consistent progress according to the established plan.

# APM Handover Protocol Guide

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the **Agentic Project Management (APM) Handover Protocol**. Its primary purpose is to ensure seamless project continuity when context transfer is required between AI agent instances. This is most commonly triggered when an active agent (typically the Manager Agent, but potentially a specialized agent like a Debugger or Implementer) approaches its operational context window limitations, threatening its ability to maintain a coherent understanding of the project's state and history.

The protocol facilitates the transfer of essential project knowledge from the outgoing ("incumbent") agent to a new, incoming agent instance, minimizing disruption and preserving the integrity of the project workflow.

This guide provides the procedural steps and content requirements for executing a successful handover. It is primarily intended for the Manager Agent overseeing the handover process but is also crucial for the User's understanding.

## 2. Trigger Conditions

The Handover Protocol should be initiated under the following circumstances:

*   **Context Window Limitation:** The incumbent agent (Manager or specialized) indicates, or the User observes, that its context window is nearing capacity, leading to potential loss of recall regarding earlier instructions, decisions, or project details.
*   **Strategic Agent Replacement:** The User decides to replace the current agent instance with a new one for strategic reasons (e.g., upgrading to a different model, re-scoping agent responsibilities).
*   **Extended Project Duration:** For projects anticipated to run significantly longer than a single agent's context lifespan, planned handovers may be scheduled proactively.

**Initiation:** The User typically initiates the handover process. However, the Manager Agent is responsible for monitoring its own context and advising the User when a handover becomes necessary due to context limitations.

## 3. Handover Components

The protocol comprises two critical artifacts generated by the incumbent Manager Agent (or the agent initiating the handover if specialized):

### 3.1. The `Handover_File.md` (Context Dump)

*   **Purpose:** To serve as a comprehensive, structured dump of all pertinent project context accumulated by the outgoing agent. This file acts as the primary knowledge base for the incoming agent.
*   **Content Requirements:** The file must encapsulate the current project state. While the specific format details are defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Formats.md`, the `Handover_File.md` must generally include:
    *   **Project Summary:** High-level goals, current status, and objectives.
    *   **Implementation Plan Status:** Link to or embed the current `Implementation_Plan.md`, highlighting completed tasks, tasks in progress, and upcoming tasks. Note any deviations or approved changes from the original plan.
    *   **Key Decisions & Rationale:** A log of significant decisions made, justifications, and User approvals.
    *   **Agent Roster & Roles:** List of active Implementation or specialized agents, their assignments, and current status (if known).
    *   **Recent Memory Bank Entries:** Summaries or verbatim copies of the most recent/relevant logs from the `Memory_Bank.md` providing immediate context on ongoing work.
    *   **Critical Code Snippets/Outputs:** Essential code, configurations, or outputs generated recently or frequently referenced.
    *   **Obstacles & Challenges:** Any known blockers, risks, or unresolved issues.
    *   **User Directives:** Record of recent or outstanding instructions from the User.
    *   **File Manifest (Optional but Recommended):** A list of key project files and their purpose.
*   **Format:** Must adhere to the structure defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Formats.md` to ensure parsability by the incoming agent.

### 3.2. The `Handover_Prompt.md` (New Agent Initialization)

*   **Purpose:** To initialize the *new* agent instance, providing it with both the standard APM framework orientation and the specific context necessary to take over the project seamlessly.
*   **Content Requirements:** This prompt is crucial and must contain:
    *   **APM Framework Introduction:** Incorporate essential sections from the standard `prompts/00_Initial_Manager_Setup/01_Initiation_Prompt.md`. This includes the APM Workflow Overview, the agent's Core Responsibilities (adapted for the incoming role, e.g., "You are taking over as Manager Agent..."), and the importance of APM assets.
    *   **Handover Context Introduction:** Clearly state that this is a handover situation.
    *   **`Handover_File.md` Summary:** Provide a concise overview of the structure and key contents of the accompanying `Handover_File.md`.
    *   **Instructions for Processing:** Explicit instructions directing the new agent to thoroughly read, parse, and internalize the contents of the `Handover_File.md`.
    *   **Immediate Objectives:** Clearly state the immediate next steps or priorities for the new agent based on the handover context (e.g., "Review Task X status", "Prepare prompt for Agent B", "Address User query regarding Y").
    *   **Verification Step:** Instruct the new agent to confirm its understanding of the handover context and its readiness to proceed by summarizing the project status and immediate objectives back to the User.
*   **Format:** Should follow the structure and principles defined for handover prompts within `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Formats.md`, ensuring clarity and actionable instructions.

## 4. Handover Procedure (Manager Agent Focus)

The incumbent Manager Agent executes the handover as follows (under User supervision):

1.  **Confirmation:** User confirms the need for handover.
2.  **`Handover_File.md` Generation:**
    *   Consult the `Handover_File_Content.md` guide for formatting.
    *   Gather all necessary context (as detailed in section 3.1).
    *   Structure and write the content into a new file named `Handover_File.md` (or a User-specified name).
    *   Present the generated file to the User for review and optional modification.
3.  **`Handover_Prompt.md` Generation:**
    *   Draft the prompt content (as detailed in section 3.2).
    *   Crucially, integrate core sections from `01_Initiation_Prompt.md`.
    *   Reference the generated `Handover_File.md`.
    *   Specify immediate next steps for the incoming agent.
    *   Present the generated prompt to the User for review and approval.
4.  **Execution:** The User takes the approved `Handover_Prompt.md` and the `Handover_File.md` and uses them to initialize the new Manager Agent instance in a fresh session.
5.  **Verification:** The new Manager Agent processes the prompt and file, then confirms its readiness and understanding to the User.

## 5. Handover for Specialized Agents

While the primary focus is on the Manager Agent, the protocol can be adapted for specialized agents (Implementer, Debugger, etc.) reaching their context limits.

*   **Initiation:** Typically triggered by the User or the Manager Agent observing context issues with the specialized agent.
*   **Responsibility:** The Manager Agent usually oversees this process.
*   **`Handover_File.md` (Simplified):** Contains context relevant *only* to the specialized agent's current task or area of responsibility (e.g., specific function being debugged, relevant code files, recent error messages, task requirements).
*   **`Handover_Prompt.md` (Simplified):** Initializes the new specialized agent instance, explains the handover, points to the simplified Handover File, and restates the specific task objectives. It does *not* typically need the full APM introduction from the Manager's initiation prompt.

## 6. Final Considerations

*   **User Oversight:** The User plays a critical role in confirming the need for handover, reviewing the generated artifacts (`Handover_File.md`, `Handover_Prompt.md`), and initiating the new agent instance.
*   **Clarity and Accuracy:** The success of the handover depends entirely on the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the Handover File and Prompt. The outgoing agent must be diligent in its generation.
*   **Iterative Process:** The User may request revisions to the Handover File or Prompt before finalizing them.

This protocol provides the standardized mechanism for maintaining project momentum and knowledge continuity within the APM framework.

### Step X: Incorporate Recent Conversational Context (Outgoing MA)

**Objective:** To ensure the handover captures not only the formally documented project state but also the most recent, potentially unlogged, user intent and directives.

**Actions:**

1.  **Review Recent Interactions:** Before finalizing the `Handover_File.md` and the `Handover_Prompt.md`, the Outgoing Manager Agent (OMA) MUST explicitly review the transcript of the last N (e.g., 5-10, or a reasonable span covering the latest significant interactions) conversational turns with the User.

2.  **Identify Key Unlogged Information:** From this review, identify:
    *   Any critical user directives or instructions.
    *   Subtle shifts in project priority or focus.
    *   New ideas or requirements expressed by the User.
    *   Contextual clarifications that significantly impact ongoing or upcoming tasks.
    *   Any information that is vital for the Incoming Manager Agent (IMA) to know but might not have been formally logged in the Memory Bank or updated in the `Implementation_Plan.md` with the same immediacy.

3.  **Summarize Findings:** Prepare a concise, bullet-point summary of this "freshest layer of user intent." Focus on actionable information or critical context.

4.  **Update Handover Artifacts:**
    *   This summary MUST be included in the dedicated section (e.g., "Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives") within the `Handover_File.md`. Refer to the `Handover_Artifact_Format.md` for the precise structure.
    *   The insights from this summary should also be used to inform and refine the `Handover_Prompt.md`, ensuring the IMA is explicitly briefed on these recent nuances.

**Rationale:** This step is crucial for bridging any potential gap between the formal, logged project state and the immediate, evolving conversational context. It provides the IMA with the most current and complete understanding of the User's expectations and the project's micro-dynamics, leading to a smoother and more effective transition.

# APM Handover Artifact Formats

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the standard Markdown formatting for the two key artifacts generated during the APM Handover Protocol (the procedure itself is detailed in `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`):

1.  **`Handover_File.md`**: The comprehensive context dump from the outgoing agent.
2.  **`Handover_Prompt.md`**: The initialization prompt for the incoming agent.

These formats apply to handovers involving **any type of agent** within the APM framework (Manager, Implementation, Specialized). Adherence to these structures is crucial for the successful transfer of project context and the seamless initialization of the new agent instance, regardless of the agent's role.

This document serves as the definitive structural reference for whoever prepares the handover artifacts (typically the Manager Agent or the User).

**Key Distinction:**
*   The `Handover_File.md` is a **data repository** structuring the project's state and history for the incoming agent.
*   The `Handover_Prompt.md` is an **instructional document** that bootstraps the new agent, guiding it on how to *use* the Handover File and resume project tasks.

## 2. `Handover_File.md` Format (Context Dump)

This file should be structured using clear Markdown headings to organize the dumped context. The following sections represent the comprehensive format, primarily intended for a Manager Agent handover. For handovers involving Specialized Agents, certain sections may be simplified or omitted by the preparer to match the agent's specific scope (see Section 4 for more on variations).

```
# APM Handover File - [Project Name/Identifier] - [Date]

## Section 1: Handover Overview

*   **Outgoing Agent ID:** [e.g., Manager_Instance_1, Implementer_B_v1]
*   **Incoming Agent ID:** [e.g., Manager_Instance_2, Implementer_B_v2] (If known)
*   **Reason for Handover:** [e.g., Context Limit Reached, Task Completion & Reassignment, Strategic Replacement]
*   **Memory Bank Configuration:**
    *   **Location(s):** [List the relative path(s) to the project's Memory_Bank.md file(s) or `Memory/` directory, e.g., `./Memory_Bank.md` or `./Memory/`]
    *   **Structure:** [e.g., Single file, Multi-file directory per phase]
*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** [1-3 sentences on the current overall state relevant to the handover scope. For specialized agents, focus on their specific task area.]

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives (Relevant Scope)

[For Manager Handovers, reiterate the main project goal and key current objectives. For Specialized Agents, state the goal of their *current specific task* or area of responsibility. Copy from original plan or provide current understanding.]

## Section 3: Implementation Plan Status (Relevant Scope)

*   **Link to Main Plan:** [Relative path to the `Implementation_Plan.md`]
*   **Current Phase/Focus:** [e.g., Phase 2: Frontend Development OR Task: Debugging login flow]
*   **Completed Tasks (within current scope or recently):**
    *   [Task ID/Reference from Plan relevant to this handover] - Status: Completed
    *   ...
*   **Tasks In Progress (within current scope):**
    *   [Task ID/Reference from Plan] - **Assigned Agent(s):** [Agent ID(s)] - **Current Status:** [Brief status, e.g., Coding underway, Blocked by X, Review pending]
    *   ...
*   **Upcoming Tasks (immediate next relevant to scope):**
    *   [Task ID/Reference from Plan] - **Intended Agent(s):** [Agent ID(s)]
    *   ...
*   **Deviations/Changes from Plan (Relevant Scope):** [Note any approved modifications relevant to the handover scope. State "None" if applicable.]

## Section 4: Key Decisions & Rationale Log (Relevant Scope)

[Summarize significant decisions relevant to the incoming agent's scope made since the last handover or task start. Focus on decisions impacting current or upcoming work.]
*   **Decision:** [e.g., Choice of X library over Y for feature Z] - **Rationale:** [Brief justification] - **Approved By:** [User/Manager] - **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
*   ...

## Section 5: Active Agent Roster & Current Assignments (Manager Handovers)

[Typically for Manager Handovers. For specialized agents, this section might be omitted or list only direct collaborators.]
*   **Manager Agent:** [ID, if different from outgoing]
*   **Implementation Agent Alpha:**
    *   **Current Task(s):** [Task ID/Reference]
    *   **Status:** [e.g., Actively working, Awaiting review, Idle]
*   *(Add/remove agents as applicable for the project)*

## Section 6: Recent Memory Bank Entries (Contextual Snippets - Highly Relevant Scope)

[Include verbatim copies or concise summaries of the *most relevant* recent entries from the specified Memory Bank(s) that the new agent needs for immediate context. Focus on entries directly related to the ongoing/upcoming tasks within the handover scope. Prioritize recency and direct applicability.]

---
[Copy of Memory Bank Entry 1 directly related to current task]
---
[Copy of Memory Bank Entry 2 directly related to current task]
---
[...]
---

## Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives

**Purpose:** This section captures critical insights, directives, or contextual shifts from the most recent (e.g., last 5-10, or as specified by the Handover Protocol) interactions with the User that might not yet be fully reflected in formal logs or the Implementation Plan. It provides the "freshest layer of user intent" for the incoming agent.

**Content:**
*   **Source:** Summary generated by the Outgoing Agent based on a review of recent conversational history immediately prior to handover.
*   **Format:** Bullet points preferred, focusing on actionable information or critical context.

**[Placeholder for Outgoing Agent to insert summary of recent conversational context and key user directives]**

*Example:*
*   *User expressed a new preference for using Model X as the primary choice for final submission (ref: conversation on YYYY-MM-DD, turn N). This overrides previous discussions on Model Y.*
*   *Clarified that the deadline for current phase is now DD-MM-YYYY (ref: User message, YYYY-MM-DD, turn M).*

## Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs (Relevant Scope)

[Embed crucial code snippets, configuration file contents, API responses, error messages, or other outputs *directly related* to the task(s) being handed over or frequently referenced. Use appropriate Markdown code blocks. Ensure this is highly targeted to avoid clutter.]

```start of python cell
# Example: Relevant function being debugged or key configuration
def specific_function_under_review(input_data):
    # ... code directly relevant to handover ...
```end of python cell

## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks (Relevant Scope)

[List any known blockers, unresolved issues, errors, technical challenges, or potential risks *specifically relevant* to the task or area being handed over. Be specific.]
*   **Blocker:** [Task ID/Description] - [Description of blocker] - **Status:** [e.g., Investigating, Waiting for User input, Pending external dependency]
*   **Error Encountered:** [Description of error] - **Details:** [Relevant log snippet, observation, or steps to reproduce if known]
*   **Potential Risk:** [Description of risk and potential impact]

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions (Relevant Scope)

[List any recent instructions *relevant to this agent/task* from the User or Manager that are still pending action, or questions awaiting answers. Distinguish from general conversational context in Section 7 by focusing on explicit, unresolved items.]
*   [Directive/Question 1: e.g., "User asked to investigate alternative library Z for Task X. Investigation pending."]
*   [Directive/Question 2: e.g., "Manager requested a performance benchmark for function Y. Not yet started."]

## Section 11: Key Project File Manifest (Relevant Scope - Optional but Recommended)

[List key files the incoming agent will likely need to interact with for their immediate task(s). Provide brief context on relevance.]
*   `src/core_module/file_x.py`: [Contains the primary logic for feature Y, currently under development.]
*   `tests/unit/test_file_x.py`: [Unit tests for feature Y; some may be failing.]
*   `config/settings.json`: [Relevant configuration for the current task.]
*   ...

```

## 3. `Handover_Prompt.md` Format (New Agent Initialization)

This prompt initializes the new agent instance, regardless of type. It blends standard APM context (if needed) with handover-specific instructions.

```start of markdown cell
# APM Agent Initialization - Handover Protocol

You are being activated as an agent ([Agent Type, e.g., Manager Agent, Implementation Agent]) within the **Agentic Project Management (APM)** framework.

**CRITICAL: This is a HANDOVER situation.** You are taking over from a previous agent instance ([Outgoing Agent ID]). Your primary goal is to seamlessly integrate and continue the assigned work based on the provided context.

## 1. APM Framework Context (As Needed for Role)

**(For Manager Agents, the preparer should integrate essential Sections 1 and 2 from `prompts/00_Initial_Manager_Setup/01_Initiation_Prompt.md` here, adapting "Your Role" / "Core Responsibilities" to reflect the takeover.)**
**(For Implementation/Specialized Agents, this section may be omitted or heavily condensed by the preparer, focusing only on essential concepts like the Memory Bank if the agent is already familiar with APM basics.)**

*   **Your Role:** [Briefly state the role and the fact you are taking over, e.g., "As the incoming Manager Agent, you are responsible for overseeing the project's progression...", "As Implementation Agent B, you are taking over Task X..."]
*   **Memory Bank:** You MUST log significant actions/results to the Memory Bank(s) located at [Path(s) from Handover File, Section 1] using the format defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Logging occurs after User confirmation of task state.
*   **User:** The primary stakeholder and your main point of communication.

## 2. Handover Context Assimilation

A detailed **`Handover_File.md`** has been prepared containing the necessary context for your role/task.

*   **File Location:** [Relative path to the generated `Handover_File.md`]
*   **File Contents Overview:** This file contains the current state of your assigned task(s) or project scope, including: Implementation Plan status, relevant decisions, recent activity logs from the Memory Bank, critical code/outputs, known obstacles, and recent User directives.

**YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK:**

1.  **Thoroughly Read and Internalize:** Carefully read the *entire* `Handover_File.md`. Pay extremely close attention to sections most relevant to your immediate responsibilities, such as:
    *   `Section 3: Implementation Plan Status` (for your assigned tasks)
    *   `Section 6: Recent Memory Bank Entries`
    *   `Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives`
    *   `Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs`
    *   `Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks`
    *   `Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions`
2.  **Identify Next Steps:** Based *only* on the information within the `Handover_File.md`, determine the most immediate priorities and the next 1-2 actions required for your role/task.
3.  **Confirm Understanding to User:** Signal your readiness to the User by:
    *   Briefly summarizing the current status *of your specific task(s) or overall project scope*, based on your understanding of the `Handover_File.md`.
    *   Listing the 1-2 most immediate, concrete actions you will take.
    *   Asking any critical clarifying questions you have that are essential *before* you can proceed with those actions. Focus on questions that, if unanswered, would prevent you from starting.

Do not begin any operational work until you have completed this assimilation and verification step with the User and received their go-ahead.

## 3. Initial Operational Objective

Once your understanding is confirmed by the User, your first operational objective will typically be:

*   **[The preparer of this prompt should state the explicit first task derived from the Handover File, e.g., "Address the primary blocker identified in Section 9 of the Handover_File.md for Task X", "Resume implementation of feature Y as detailed in Section 3 and Section 8 of the Handover_File.md", "Prepare the task assignment prompt for the next sub-task identified in Section 3", "Action the outstanding User directive noted in Section 10"]**

Proceed with the Handover Context Assimilation now. Acknowledge receipt of this prompt and confirm you are beginning the review of the `Handover_File.md`.
```

## 4. Notes on Variations for Specialized Agent Handovers

As indicated in the templates above, handovers for Specialized Agents (e.g., Implementer, Debugger, Tester) typically involve **scope-limited versions** of these formats:

*   **`Handover_File.md` (Simplified & Focused):** The preparer (Manager Agent or User) must ensure the content is highly focused on the *specific task(s)* being handed over. Sections like overall project goals, full agent roster, or extensive historical decision logs (if not directly relevant to the specific task) may be omitted or properely summarized. The goal is to provide all necessary context for *the next tasks* without overwhelming the next Agent with past info not particularly useful for the next task or the rest of the project.
*   **`Handover_Prompt.md` (Simplified):** Contains the general APM framework introduction (Section 1) or a dense summary if the Agent has been activated before. Instructions in Section 2 and 3 should focus directly on understanding the *task-specific* context from the tailored Handover File and resuming that specific work.

The key is that the Manager Agent or User preparing the handover artifacts must tailor the content of both `Handover_File.md` and `Handover_Prompt.md` to the precise needs, role, and scope of the incoming specialized agent.

## 5. General Formatting Notes

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Prioritize clear, unambiguous language. While comprehensive for Manager Handovers, always focus information on what the incoming agent *needs* to proceed effectively within its designated scope.
*   **Recency and Relevance:** Emphasize the most recent and directly relevant information, especially for Memory Bank entries, conversational context, and outputs.
*   **Markdown Usage:** Use standard Markdown consistently for headings, lists, code blocks, etc., to ensure readability by both humans and AI agents.
*   **Placeholders:** Replace all bracketed placeholders `[like this]` with the actual project-specific information.
*   **Verification Step:** The User confirmation step outlined in the `Handover_Prompt.md` (Section 2, item 3) is crucial; ensure the instructions for the incoming agent are explicit about summarizing status, next actions, and asking critical questions.

# APM Implementation/Specialized Agent Onboarding Protocol

Welcome! You are being activated as an **Implementation Agent** (or a Specialized Agent, e.g., Debugger, Tester) within the **Agentic Project Management (APM)**.

This framework uses a structured approach with multiple AI agents, coordinated by a central Manager Agent, to execute projects effectively, developed by CobuterMan. Your role is crucial for the project's success.

## 1. Understanding Your Role & the APM Workflow

*   **Your Primary Role:** Your core function is to **execute specific tasks** assigned to you based on a detailed project plan. This involves understanding the requirements provided, performing the necessary actions (e.g., writing code, analyzing data, debugging, testing), and meticulously documenting your work.
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   You will receive task assignments and instructions **from the User**. These prompts are prepared by the **Manager Agent** based on the overall project plan (`Implementation_Plan.md`).
    *   You interact **directly with the User**, who acts as the communication bridge. You will report your progress, results, or any issues back to the User.
    *   The User relays your updates back to the Manager Agent for review and coordination.
*   **The Memory Bank (`Memory_Bank.md`):** This is a critical component. It's one or more shared document(s) serving as the project's official log.
    *   **You MUST log your activities, outputs, and results** to the designated `Memory_Bank.md` file upon completing tasks or reaching significant milestones, *after receiving confirmation from the User*.
    *   Adherence to the standard logging format, defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`, is mandatory. Consistent logging ensures the Manager Agent and User can track progress accurately.
*   **Clarity is Key:** If any task assignment is unclear, or if you lack necessary context or information, it is your responsibility to **ask clarifying questions** to the User *before* proceeding with the task.

## 2. Your First Task Assignment

This onboarding prompt provides the general context of the APM framework and your role within it.

**Your actual task assignment will follow in the next prompt from the User.**

That subsequent prompt will contain:
*   Specific objectives for your first task.
*   Detailed action steps based on the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
*   Any necessary code snippets, file paths, or contextual information.
*   Expected outputs or deliverables.
*   Explicit instructions to log your work upon completion (referencing the `Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`).

Please familiarize yourself with the role and workflow described above.

**Acknowledge that you have received and understood this onboarding information.** State that you are ready to receive your first task assignment prompt.

# APM Memory Bank Log Format & Logging Instructions

## Purpose and Guiding Principles

Log entries are crucial for project tracking, context preservation, and effective handover between agents or project phases. They must be **concise yet informative**. The goal is to provide a clear summary of actions undertaken, key decisions made, critical outputs generated, and any significant issues encountered along with their resolutions. Logs are not intended to be an exhaustive transcript of all activities or a verbatim copy of all generated code or data.

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the standard format for all entries made to the project's `Memory_Bank.md` file(s) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework. It also provides direct instructions for any agent tasked with logging their work.

**Adherence to this format is mandatory** to ensure consistency, facilitate review by the Manager Agent and User, enable effective context handovers, maintain a clear project history, and provide traceability between tasks and outcomes.

## 2. Instructions for Logging Agents (Implementation, Specialized, etc.)

*   **When to Log:** You MUST add an entry to the designated `Memory_Bank.md` file IMMEDIATELY upon completing any assigned task or sub-task, reaching a significant milestone (e.g., completing a major function, finishing a complex module setup), encountering a blocker, or generating a notable result/output pertinent to your task. **Crucially, you will need to inform the User about the state of your task and he shall decide whether to log and report back to the Manager or not.**
*   **Consult Your Prompt:** Your task assignment prompt, provided by the Manager Agent via the User, should explicitly instruct you to log your work according to this guide upon completion. Refer back to it if unsure about task scope.
*   **Locate the Memory Bank:** The Manager Agent or User will specify the path to the correct `Memory_Bank.md` file (there might be multiple for large projects). If unsure, ask for clarification. Log entries should typically be appended to the end of the file.
*   **Use the Defined Format:** Structure your log entry precisely according to the Markdown format outlined in Section 3 below. Pay close attention to required fields and formatting.
*   **Be Clear and Concise:** Provide enough detail for the Manager Agent to understand *what* you did, *why* (linking to task requirements), *what* the outcome was, and any issues encountered. Avoid excessive verbosity but ensure all critical information is present.
*   **Use Exact Task Reference:** Copy the *exact* Task Identifier (e.g., `Phase 1 / Task A / Item 2`) from the `Implementation_Plan.md` or your assignment prompt into the `Task Reference` field.
*   **Code Changes:** When logging code modifications, use standard code blocks (` ` and ``` ```). Clearly indicate the file modified. Providing the changed snippets is often more useful than the entire file. Use diff-like syntax (`+` for additions, `-` for deletions) within the code block *if it adds clarity*, but do not use the specific `diff` language specifier in the code block fence (```diff).
*   **Errors and Blockers:** If the log is about an error or a blockage then clearly state any errors encountered or reasons why a task could not be completed. Provide relevant error messages or stack traces within the `Output/Result` or `Issues/Blockers` section. If blocked, explain the blocker clearly so the Manager Agent can understand the impediment.

## 3. Memory Bank Entry Format (Markdown)

Each log entry must be clearly separated from the previous one using a Markdown horizontal rule (`---`) and must follow this structure:

```markdown
---
**Agent:** [Your Assigned Agent ID, e.g., Agent B, Debugger 1 - Use the identifier assigned by the Manager Agent]
**Task Reference:** [Exact reference from Implementation_Plan.md, e.g., Task B, Sub-task 2 OR Phase 1 / Task C / Item 3]

**Summary:**
[A brief (1-2 sentence) high-level summary of the action taken or the result logged. What was the main point?]

**Details:**
[More detailed explanation of the work performed. Include:
    - Steps taken in logical order.
    - Rationale for significant decisions made during the task (especially if deviating or making choices).
    - Link actions back to specific requirements mentioned in the task description if applicable.
    - Observations or key findings.]

**Output/Result:**
[Include relevant outputs here. Use Markdown code blocks (```) for code snippets, terminal logs, or command outputs. Indicate file paths for created/modified files. For code changes, show the relevant snippet. Textual results or summaries can be placed directly. If output is large, consider saving to a separate file and referencing the path here.]
```[code snippet, command output, file path reference, or textual result]```

**Status:** [Choose ONE:
    - **Completed:** The assigned task/sub-task was finished successfully according to requirements.
    - **Partially Completed:** Significant progress made, but the task is not fully finished. Explain what remains in Details or Next Steps.
    - **Blocked:** Unable to proceed due to an external factor or prerequisite not being met. Explain in Issues/Blockers.
    - **Error:** An error occurred that prevented successful completion. Explain in Issues/Blockers and provide error details in Output/Result.
    - **Information Only:** Logging a finding, decision, or observation not tied to direct task completion.]

**Issues/Blockers:**
[Describe any issues encountered, errors that occurred (if not fully detailed in Output), or reasons for being blocked. Be specific and provide actionable information if possible. State "None" if no issues.]

**Next Steps (Optional):**
[Note any immediate follow-up actions required from you or expected from others, or the next logical task if partially completed. Useful for guiding the Manager Agent. Otherwise, state "None" or omit.]

```

## 4. Example Entry

```markdown
---
**Agent:** Agent A
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task A / Item 2 (Implement Registration Endpoint)

**Summary:**
Implemented the backend API endpoint for user registration (`POST /api/users/register`), including input validation and password hashing.

**Details:**
- Created the API route `POST /api/users/register` in `routes/user.js` as specified.
- Added input validation using `express-validator` library to check for valid email format and minimum password length (8 characters), matching requirements.
- Integrated `bcrypt` library (cost factor 12) for secure password hashing before storage, as per security best practices.
- Wrote logic to store the new user record in the PostgreSQL database using the configured ORM (`User` model).
- Ensured only non-sensitive user data (ID, email, name) is returned upon successful registration to prevent data leakage. Tested endpoint locally with sample valid and invalid data.

**Output/Result:**
```start of cell
// Snippet from routes/user.js showing validation and hashing logic
router.post(
  '/register',
  [
    check('email', 'Please include a valid email').isEmail(),
    check('password','Please enter a password with 8 or more characters').isLength({ min: 8 })
  ],
  async (req, res) => {
    // ... validation error handling ...
    const { name, email, password } = req.body;
    try {
      let user = await User.findOne({ email });
      if (user) {
        return res.status(400).json({ errors: [{ msg: 'User already exists' }] });
      }
      user = new User({ name, email, password });
      const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);
      user.password = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
      await user.save();
      // Return JWT or user object (omitting password)
      // ... token generation logic ...
      res.json({ token }); // Example response
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err.message);
      res.status(500).send('Server error');
    }
  }
);
```end of cell

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Ready to proceed with Task A / Item 3 (Implement Login Endpoint).
```

## Achieving Conciseness and Informativeness

To ensure logs are valuable without being overwhelming, adhere to the following principles:

*   **Summarize, Don't Transcribe:** Instead of detailing every minor step or internal thought process, summarize the overall action and its outcome. 
    *   *Less Effective:* "I decided to look at the data file. I opened the `train.csv` file. I then ran the `.head()` command to see the first few rows. Then I ran `.info()` to see the data types. Then I ran `.describe()`."
    *   *More Effective:* "Loaded `train.csv`. Initial inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` revealed [key observation, e.g., data types, presence of nulls, basic stats distribution]."

*   **Focus on Key Information:** Prioritize information that is critical for another agent or a human reviewer to understand:
    *   What was the objective of this task segment?
    *   What were the key actions taken to achieve it?
    *   What were the significant findings or outputs?
    *   What decisions were made, and what was the brief rationale?
    *   Were there any unexpected issues, and how were they addressed?

*   **Code Snippets - Use Sparingly:**
    *   Include code snippets *only if* they are short, essential for understanding a specific, novel, or complex solution, or represent a critical configuration. 
    *   Do NOT include lengthy blocks of boilerplate code, common library calls that can be easily inferred, or extensive script outputs.
    *   If extensive code needs to be referenced (e.g., a utility function written), state that it was created/modified and committed to the relevant script file, then reference that file.

*   **Avoid Redundancy:** If information is clearly documented and accessible in another primary project artifact (e.g., the `Implementation_Plan.md` outlines the task goal, a committed script contains the full code), briefly reference that artifact instead of repeating its content extensively in the log.
    *   *Example:* "Implemented the preprocessing steps as defined in Task 2.3 of `Implementation_Plan.md`. The core function `preprocess_text()` was added to `scripts/preprocessing_utils.py`."

## Examples of Log Entry Detail

Consider the task: "Load and inspect training and validation datasets."

**1. Good Concise Log Entry:**

```
### Log Entry

*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Summary:** Loaded `train_dataset.csv` (10000x3) and `val_dataset.csv` (2000x3). Initial inspection shows 'text' and 'sentiment' columns. No missing values in 'sentiment'. 'text' column has a few nulls in train (5) and val (2) that will need handling. Sentiment distribution appears balanced in train, slightly skewed towards positive in val. Average text length is X characters.
*   **Outputs:** train_df, val_df shapes logged. Null value counts recorded.
*   **Decisions:** Confirmed data loading successful. Noted nulls for next preprocessing step.
*   **Issues:** None.
```

**2. Overly Verbose Log Entry (To Avoid):**

```
### Log Entry

*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Summary:** I started by thinking about loading the data. The plan said to load `train_dataset.csv`. So I wrote `train_df = pd.read_csv('data/train_dataset.csv')`. This command ran successfully. Then I wanted to see the data, so I did `print(train_df.head())`. The output was [outputs head]. Then I ran `print(train_df.info())` which showed [outputs info]. I also checked for nulls with `train_df.isnull().sum()` which showed [outputs nulls]. I did the same for `val_dataset.csv`. I wrote `val_df = pd.read_csv('data/val_dataset.csv')`. This also worked. I printed its head and info too. It seems the data is okay. The shapes are (10000,3) and (2000,3). 
*   **Outputs:** Printed head of train_df, info of train_df, nulls of train_df. Printed head of val_df, info of val_df, nulls of val_df.
*   **Decisions:** Decided the files loaded correctly.
*   **Issues:** Took a while to type all the print statements.

# It's good practice to ensure Oid objects are real if they are used in comparisons or as dict keys
# For mocking, often the object identity or specific attributes are what's checked.
# The Oid hex values used are just for creating distinct mock Oid objects.
# pygit2.Oid(hex="...") is a valid way to create an Oid instance.
# Ensure pygit2 itself is imported if creating real Oid objects.
# `from pygit2 import Signature, Oid` might be needed at the top.
# The current mock_repo fixture uses pygit2.Oid correctly.
# The main CLI file already imports `pygit2` and `os` and `pathlib.Path`
# `from pygit2 import Signature` is used in main.py
# `pygit2.GIT_OBJECT_COMMIT` etc are used.

# For the mock_repo, ensure that if repo[oid] is called, it can return a suitable object.
# The getitem mock in mock_repo is a good start.
# In test_tag_list_only_annotated and test_tag_list_mixed_tags,
# repo.__getitem__ is refined with a side_effect to return specific objects based on OID.
# This is crucial for resolving tag.target or annotated_tag.target.

# Consider if pygit2.GIT_STATUS_CURRENT is needed for any tag tests; likely not.
# `pygit2.object_type_to_string` is used in list, ensure pygit2 is available.
# The command itself imports `Table` and `Console` from `rich` only when needed. Tests don't need to mock that part.

# Final check on imports for the test file itself:
# pytest, CliRunner, MagicMock, patch, ANY, pygit2, os, cli (from gitwrite_cli.main)
# Looks good.
# ANY from unittest.mock can be useful if you don't care about a specific argument.
# e.g. mock_repo.create_tag.assert_called_once_with("v1.0-annotated", ANY, ...)
# But being specific (like with mock_repo.revparse_single.return_value.id) is better.

## [0.3.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New section in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Handover_Artifact_Format.md` for "Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives" in the `Handover_File.md`.

### Changed
- **Memory System Robustness (High Priority):**
  - Updated `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/02_Memory_Bank_Guide.md` to mandate strict adherence to `Implementation_Plan.md` for all directory/file naming and to include a validation step before creation. Phase and Task naming conventions clarified.
  - Significantly revised `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md` to emphasize conciseness, provide clear principles for achieving it, and added concrete examples of good vs. overly verbose log entries.
  - Updated `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/03_Task_Assignment_Prompts_Guide.md` to instruct Manager Agents to explicitly remind specialized agents of their obligations regarding Memory Bank structure and log quality (this earlier change remains valid alongside the newer one below).
- **Handover Protocol Enhancement:**
  - Modified `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md` to include a new mandatory step for the Outgoing Manager Agent: review recent conversational turns with the User and incorporate a summary of unlogged critical directives or contextual shifts into the handover artifacts.
- **Implementation Plan and Task Assignment Process:**
  - Enhanced `prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/01_Implementation_Plan_Guide.md` to:
    - Emphasize and clarify the requirement for explicit agent assignment per task.
    - Mandate the inclusion of brief "Guiding Notes" (e.g., key methods, libraries, parameters) within task action steps to ensure inter-task consistency and provide clearer direction.

## Conclusion

The GitWrite platform represents a significant opportunity to bring Git's proven version control capabilities to the writing community while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Git ecosystem. By leveraging Git's built-in features rather than reinventing them, we can provide writers with a powerful, familiar system that integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows and Git hosting services.

Key advantages of our Git-native approach:

**Proven Technology Foundation**: Git's 18+ years of development and optimization provides a robust, battle-tested foundation for version control operations.

**Ecosystem Compatibility**: Writers can use GitWrite alongside standard Git tools, collaborate with developers, and leverage existing Git hosting infrastructure.

**No Vendor Lock-in**: All GitWrite repositories are standard Git repositories that can be used with any Git tool or hosting service.

**Scalability**: Git's distributed architecture naturally scales from individual writers to large collaborative projects.

**Future-Proofing**: By building on Git's foundation, GitWrite benefits from ongoing Git development and remains compatible with future Git innovations.

The project's success depends on careful attention to user experience while maintaining Git's powerful capabilities underneath. Our writer-friendly abstractions must feel natural to non-technical users while preserving the full power of Git for those who want it.

With proper execution, GitWrite can become the bridge that brings Git's collaboration model to the writing world, enabling new forms of literary collaboration while maintaining compatibility with the broader software development ecosystem.

**Agent:** Manager Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Project State Summary - CLI MVP

**Summary:**
The GitWrite CLI MVP development has progressed through the implementation of core features including `init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, and `revert`. Testing for `revert` and `init` is complete. A bug in `init` was found and fixed. A reported `sync` typo was investigated and found to be likely already resolved.

**Details:**
- **Implemented Commands:**
    - `gitwrite init [project_name]`: Initializes project structure.
    - `gitwrite save "message" [-i <path1> [-i <path2> ...]]`: Stages changes and commits.
        - Default behavior (no `-i`/`--include`): Stages all changes (new, modified, deleted files) in the working directory and creates a commit.
        - Handles finalization of merge commits (after conflict resolution by user).
        - Handles finalization of revert commits (after conflict resolution by user).
        - **Selective Staging with `--include` / `-i`:**
            - **Usage:** `gitwrite save -i <path1> -i <path2> ... "message"`
            - **Behavior:**
                - If `--include` is used, only the specified paths (files or directories) will be staged for the commit.
                - If a directory is specified, all changes within that directory are staged.
                - If no `--include` is specified, all changes in the working directory are staged (default behavior).
            - **Error Handling / Warnings (for `--include`):**
                - If a specified path is not found in the repository, has no changes, or is ignored by `.gitignore`, a warning is printed. The command will proceed with any other valid files specified.
                - If none of the specified paths have any changes or if all specified paths are invalid (e.g., non-existent, ignored, no changes), the command will output messages indicating this and state "No changes to save." No commit will be made.
            - **Interaction with Merge/Revert (for `--include`):**
                - Using `--include` is **disallowed** when the repository is in an active merge state (`MERGE_HEAD` exists) or an active revert state (`REVERT_HEAD` exists). An error message will be displayed, and no action will be taken.
                - To complete a merge or revert operation, `gitwrite save "message"` (i.e., without `--include`) must be used. This will stage all resolved changes and finalize the operation.
    - `gitwrite history [-n count]`: Displays formatted commit history.
    - `gitwrite explore <branch_name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
    - `gitwrite switch [<branch_name>]`: Switches to an existing branch or lists branches.
    - `gitwrite merge <branch_name>`: Merges branches, handling fast-forwards, normal merges, and conflicts (manual resolution + `gitwrite save`).
    - `gitwrite compare [ref1] [ref2]`: Displays word-level diff.
    - `gitwrite sync [--remote <remote>] [--branch <branch>]`: Fetches, pulls/merges, and pushes changes.
    - `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]`: Reverts specified commit (non-merge commits fully supported; merge commits have limitations).
- **Code Committed:**
    - Features up to `sync` were on `cli-mvp-features`.
    - The `revert` command and its tests were developed on the `feature/revert-command` branch.
    - `init` command tests and a related bugfix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` are part of the current work.

**Output/Result:**
- **Committed Code:** Branch `feature/revert-command` contains the `revert` feature. Other features are on `cli-mvp-features` or merged to main. Recent `init` tests and fixes are pending commit/merge.
- **Known Typo:** In `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (sync command) - **INVESTIGATED**: Typo `paciente=True` not found; likely already fixed or misreported.
- **Identified Limitation:** `gitwrite revert` cannot perform index-only reverts of merge commits with specific mainline parent selection due to underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` behavior in v1.18.0; CLI now errors gracefully for this case.
- **Bug Fix (init):** Corrected `repo.status_file()` call in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to use relative path for `.gitignore`, fixing an idempotency issue.

**Status:** Testing and Refinement in Progress

**Issues/Blockers (Current):**
- No major environment blockers.

**Completed Original Plan Items (Previously Blocked):**
- Step 8: Implement `gitwrite revert` - **DONE** (with noted limitations for merge commits)
- Step 9: Develop Unit and Integration Tests (for `revert`) - **DONE**

**Remaining Original Plan Items (Adjusted):**
- Comprehensive testing for *all* CLI commands. (`init` and `revert` commands now have good test coverage).
- Address `sync` command typo. - **DONE** (Investigated, typo not found, likely already fixed or misreported).
- Step 10: Create User Documentation.
- Step 11: Refine CLI and Address Issues (e.g., review `revert` merge limitations for future improvement if library changes; bug in `init` regarding `status_file` path was fixed).
- Step 12: Update `Memory_Bank.md` file - This log entry. (Ongoing)
- Step 13: Add Memory Bank and Handover Protocol notes to `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Step 14: Finalize the initial CLI application.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- **Your Action:**
    - Review and merge `feature/revert-command` (if not already done).
    - Prioritize next development tasks:
        - Continue comprehensive testing for other CLI commands (`save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, `tag`, `ignore`).
        - Begin work on User Documentation (Step 10).
- **My Action:** Awaiting your guidance.

**Update: `init` Command Testing, `sync` Typo Investigation, and `init` Bug Fix**

This update covers the investigation of a reported typo in the `sync` command, the successful implementation of comprehensive tests for the `gitwrite init` command, and a bug fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` that was discovered during this testing phase.

**1. `sync` Command Typo (`paciente=True`) Investigation:**
-   A thorough review of the `gitwrite_cli/main.py` file, specifically the `sync` command, was conducted. This included manual code inspection and `grep` searches for the term "paciente".
-   **Conclusion:** The reported typo `paciente=True` was **not found** in the codebase.
    -   All `click.echo` statements within the `sync` command correctly use `err=True` for error messages intended for `stderr`, or no `err` parameter (which defaults to `err=False`, i.e., `stdout`) for standard informational messages.
    -   It is presumed that the typo was either fixed in a previous, unlogged commit or the initial report was inaccurate regarding the parameter name or its existence.
    -   This item is now considered closed.

**2. `gitwrite init` Command Testing:**
-   A new test class, `TestGitWriteInit`, was added to `tests/test_main.py` to provide comprehensive test coverage for the `gitwrite init` command.
-   **Key Scenarios Tested and Passing (8 tests in total):**
    -   Successful initialization in an empty current directory (when no project name is provided).
    -   Successful initialization when a `project_name` is specified (creating the project directory).
    -   Correct creation of the standard GitWrite project structure: `drafts/`, `notes/` directories, `metadata.yml` file, and `.gitkeep` files within `drafts/` and `notes/`.
    -   Generation of a `.gitignore` file with common Python and IDE ignore patterns.
    -   Verification of the initial commit: correct commit message, author details (GitWrite System), and presence of core structure files in the commit tree.
    -   Error handling for invalid target names:
        -   When the specified `project_name` already exists as a file.
        -   When the `project_name` directory exists, is not empty, and is not a Git repository.
    -   Correct behavior when `init` is run in an existing Git repository (i.e., adds GitWrite structure and files, creates a new commit, but does not re-initialize the `.git` directory).
    -   Error handling when `init` is run in a non-empty current directory that is not a Git repository (and no project name is given).
    -   Verification that `init` correctly appends GitWrite-specific patterns to a pre-existing `.gitignore` file, preserving user's custom entries.
    -   Idempotency: ensuring that running `init` multiple times in an already correctly initialized GitWrite directory does not create redundant new commits.
-   All tests for `TestGitWriteInit` are currently passing.

**3. Bug Fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (related to `init` command):**
-   **Discovery:** During the development of the idempotency test for `gitwrite init` (`test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure`), a bug was uncovered. When `init` was run a second time in an already initialized directory, an unexpected `KeyError` related to `.gitignore` would occur.
-   **Root Cause:** The `init` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was calling `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))`. The function `repo.status_file()` expects a path relative to the repository's working directory, but `str(gitignore_file)` was providing an absolute path. This caused `pygit2` to raise a `KeyError` when it couldn't find the absolute path in its internal representation of the working tree.
-   **Fix:** The call was changed from `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))` to `repo.status_file(gitignore_file.name)`. Since `gitignore_file` is defined as `target_dir / ".gitignore"`, `gitignore_file.name` correctly provides the relative filename `".gitignore"`.
-   This fix allowed the `test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure` to pass and ensures more robust behavior for the `init` command.

---
**Update: `gitwrite revert` Implementation and Testing**

The `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]` command has been successfully implemented and tested.

**Key Features & Details:**
-   **Non-Merge Commits:** Successfully reverts non-merge commits. A new commit is created with a standard message format (e.g., "Revert '[original commit message]'"), and the working directory reflects the undone changes.
-   **Conflict Handling:** If a revert attempt results in conflicts, the command updates the index with conflict markers and creates `REVERT_HEAD`. It then instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts and use `gitwrite save "message"` to complete the revert.
-   **`gitwrite save` Enhancement:** The `save` command was updated to detect the presence of `REVERT_HEAD`. If found, it automatically prepends the standard "Revert '[original commit message]'" to the user's provided save message, ensuring clear commit history for resolved reverts. It also correctly cleans up `REVERT_HEAD` (and `MERGE_HEAD` if applicable) via `repo.state_cleanup()`.
-   **Merge Commit Reverts (Limitation Identified):**
    *   During development, it was discovered that `pygit2.Repository.revert()` (version 1.18.0, as installed in the environment) does not reliably support specifying a mainline parent for merge commits when the goal is to *only update the index* (as opposed to directly creating the revert commit). Attempts to pass `mainline` as a keyword or positional argument led to various `TypeError` or specific errors from `libgit2` (e.g., "mainline branch is not specified..."). `RevertOptions` was also found to be not directly importable from `pygit2` in this version.
    *   Consequently, the `gitwrite revert` command now detects if the target commit is a merge commit. If so, it informs the user that this specific operation (index-only revert of a merge commit, especially with mainline selection) is not supported with the current underlying library method and fails gracefully with an error message. The `--mainline` option is therefore only relevant for informational purposes if a future `pygit2` version or method allows it.
-   **Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `revert` command were added to `tests/test_main.py`.
    *   Scenarios covered include: successful non-merge reverts, reverting an initial commit, reverting a revert commit, attempts to revert with a dirty working directory, invalid commit references, and handling of conflicts (including resolution via `gitwrite save`).
    *   The merge commit revert test was updated to assert that the CLI now correctly identifies merge commits and informs the user of the current limitation.
    *   All 12 tests in the suite are currently passing.
-   **Dependencies:** Python package dependencies (`click`, `pygit2==1.18.0`, `rich`, `pytest`) were installed and utilized during development and testing.

This work effectively completes the `revert` command implementation as per the original plan, within the constraints discovered with the `pygit2` library.
---
**Update: `gitwrite save` Command Testing**

Comprehensive testing for the `gitwrite save` command has been implemented, covering normal operations and conflict scenarios.

**1. Helper Fixtures and Functions:**
To support robust testing of the `save` command, the following helper fixtures and functions were added to `tests/test_main.py`:
-   **Fixtures:**
    -   `repo_with_unstaged_changes`: Creates a repository with a new file that has unstaged changes.
    -   `repo_with_staged_changes`: Creates a repository with a new file that has already been staged.
    -   `repo_with_merge_conflict`: Sets up a repository state where a merge conflict exists (MERGE_HEAD is present, and index has conflicts).
    -   `repo_with_revert_conflict`: Sets up a repository state where a revert operation has resulted in conflicts (REVERT_HEAD is present, and index has conflicts).
-   **Helper Functions:**
    -   `create_file(repo, filename, content)`: Utility to easily create a file in the test repository's working directory.
    -   `stage_file(repo, filename)`: Utility to stage a specified file.
    -   `resolve_conflict(repo, filename, resolved_content)`: Utility to simulate conflict resolution by writing resolved content to a file, adding it to the index, and removing the conflict entry from the index.

**2. Test Coverage for Normal Save Scenarios:**
A new test class, `TestGitWriteSaveNormalScenarios`, was added to `tests/test_main.py`. These tests cover standard `save` operations:
-   `test_save_new_file`: Verifies that a new, previously untracked and unstaged file is correctly committed with the given message.
-   `test_save_existing_file_modified`: Verifies that modifications to an existing, tracked file (unstaged) are committed.
-   `test_save_no_changes`: Checks that the `save` command correctly identifies when there are no changes to commit (neither in the working directory nor staged) and does not create an empty commit.
-   `test_save_staged_changes`: Ensures that changes already staged (e.g., via `git add` or a previous `gitwrite` operation that only staged) are properly committed.
-   `test_save_no_message`: Tests the behavior when a commit message is not provided with the `save` command. The test is designed to accommodate implementations where this might result in an error or the use of a default commit message.

**3. Test Coverage for Conflict Scenarios:**
A new test class, `TestGitWriteSaveConflictScenarios`, was added to `tests/test_main.py`. These tests focus on how `gitwrite save` behaves during and after merge and revert conflicts:
-   **Merge Conflicts:**
    -   `test_save_with_unresolved_merge_conflict`: Confirms that if `save` is invoked while there are unresolved merge conflicts (MERGE_HEAD exists), the command fails or warns the user, and no commit is made.
    -   `test_save_after_resolving_merge_conflict`: Verifies that after a merge conflict is manually resolved (simulated with `resolve_conflict` helper) and staged, `gitwrite save` successfully creates a merge commit. It also checks that the repository is no longer in a merge state (MERGE_HEAD is cleared).
-   **Revert Conflicts:**
    -   `test_save_with_unresolved_revert_conflict`: Confirms that if `save` is invoked while there are unresolved conflicts from a `gitwrite revert` operation (REVERT_HEAD exists), the command fails or warns the user, and the revert is not finalized.
    -   `test_save_after_resolving_revert_conflict`: Verifies that after a revert conflict is manually resolved and staged, `gitwrite save` successfully creates a commit that finalizes the revert. It checks that the commit message correctly reflects the revert and that the repository is no longer in a revert state (REVERT_HEAD is cleared).

**4. Test Status:**
-   All new tests for the `gitwrite save` command, covering both normal and conflict scenarios, are **passing**.

This suite of tests significantly improves the reliability and robustness of the `gitwrite save` command.

**CLI Command Updates and Fixes**

This section details recent updates and bug fixes made to specific GitWrite CLI commands based on testing and refinement.

1.  **`gitwrite revert <commit_ref>` Command (Merge Commit Handling):**
    *   **Limitation Confirmed & Test Updated:** The `gitwrite revert` command currently does not support reverting merge commits directly due to limitations in the underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` method (v1.18.0) for index-only reverts, especially when mainline parent selection is needed.
    *   The command will output a specific error message if a merge commit is targeted for revert.
    *   The test `test_revert_successful_merge_commit` in `tests/test_main.py` was updated to assert this expected error behavior, ensuring the CLI gracefully handles this scenario.

2.  **`gitwrite save` Command (During Revert with Unresolved Conflicts):**
    *   **Bug Fix:** A bug was identified where `gitwrite save`, when used during a revert operation that resulted in unresolved conflicts, was not providing the most specific error message. It would indicate generic unresolved conflicts rather than clearly stating it was due to the ongoing revert.
    *   **Resolution:** The `save` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was updated to explicitly check if `REVERT_HEAD` is present and if conflicts exist *before* attempting to stage all changes. If this condition is met, it now outputs a more precise error: "Error: Unresolved conflicts detected during revert." and instructs the user to resolve them before saving.
    *   The test `test_save_with_unresolved_revert_conflict` in `tests/test_main.py` now passes, verifying that this fix correctly identifies and reports the unresolved *revert* conflict.

# Implementation Plan

Project Goal: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for GitWrite, a Git-based version control platform specifically designed for writers, enabling writer-friendly commands and workflows while maintaining full Git compatibility. This initial phase focuses on the MVP for the CLI.

## General Project Notes
*   **Memory Bank System:** Single file `Memory_Bank.md` has been agreed upon.
*   **Primary Agent for CLI Development (Original Plan):** Agent_CLI_Dev
*   **Agent for QA (Original Plan):** Agent_QA
*   **Git Interaction Strategy:** Prioritize using `pygit2` (libgit2 bindings) for programmatic Git operations. Fall back to direct Git command-line calls via `subprocess` only for operations not straightforwardly available or significantly more complex with `pygit2`.
*   **Current Status:** Active development. Task 3.1 completed. Ready for next tasks.

---

## Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation

### Task 3.1 - Implement `gitwrite revert`
Objective: Implement `gitwrite revert <commit_ref>` to revert changes introduced by a specific commit, creating a new commit.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Defined `revert <commit_ref>` command using Click.
2.  Implemented Git revert logic using `pygit2` (`repo.revert()`).
    - Successfully implemented. Reverts non-merge commits and creates a new commit.
    - Handles conflicts by instructing manual resolution and using `gitwrite save` (which was enhanced to create appropriate revert commit messages when completing a conflicted revert).
    - Note: Reverting merge commits directly with `pygit2.Repository.revert()` and mainline selection showed limitations with `pygit2 v1.18.0`. The CLI currently disallows this specific operation with an error, guiding users to alternative Git strategies for such cases if needed.
3.  If revert is successful (no conflicts):
    - Created a new commit with a standard revert message.
4.  If conflicts occur during revert:
    - Provided feedback about conflicts.
    - Instructed user to resolve conflicts and run `gitwrite save`.

### Task 3.X - Implement Selective Staging for `save` Command
Objective: Enhance the `gitwrite save` command to allow users to specify which files to stage and commit.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Modify `gitwrite_cli/main.py`:
    *   Added `--include` / `-i` option to the `save` command.
    *   Implemented logic to stage only specified files/directories if `--include` is used.
    *   Added error handling for invalid paths (not found, no changes, ignored) and for using `--include` during active merge/revert operations.
    *   Status: **Completed**
2.  Add Unit Tests to `tests/test_main.py`:
    *   Created `TestGitWriteSaveSelectiveStaging` class.
    *   Added tests for various scenarios: single/multiple file/directory inclusion, unmodified/non-existent/ignored files, interaction with merge/revert states, and default behavior.
    *   Status: **Completed**
3.  Update Documentation (`Memory_Bank.md`, `Implementation_Plan.md`):
    *   Documented the new `--include` option in `Memory_Bank.md`, detailing its usage, behavior, warnings, and limitations (especially concerning merge/revert states).
    *   Updated this implementation plan (`Implementation_Plan.md`) to include this task and mark it as completed.
    *   Status: **Completed**

### Task 3.2 - Implement `gitwrite ignore`
Objective: Implement commands to manage `.gitignore` entries.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Defined `ignore add <pattern>` subcommand:
    *   Allows adding a specified pattern to the project's `.gitignore` file.
    *   Handles creation of `.gitignore` if it doesn't exist.
    *   Prevents duplicate entries.
    *   Provides user feedback on success or if pattern already exists.
2.  Defined `ignore list` subcommand:
    *   Displays the contents of the `.gitignore` file.
    *   Informs the user if the file is not found or is empty.
3.  Implemented logic to read, append to, and display `.gitignore` entries.
4.  Added comprehensive unit tests for both subcommands, covering various scenarios including adding new/duplicate patterns, whitespace handling, and listing different states of the `.gitignore` file. All tests are passing.

### Task 3.3 - Implement `gitwrite tag`
Objective: Implement commands for creating and listing tags.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Defined `tag add <name> [commit_ref] [-m <message>]` subcommand:
    *   Creates a new tag.
    *   If `-m/--message` is provided, an annotated tag is created using `repo.create_tag()`. The tagger is determined from the Git config or environment variables.
    *   Otherwise, a lightweight tag is created using `repo.references.create()`.
    *   The tag points to `commit_ref` (defaults to `HEAD`).
    *   Handles cases like existing tags, empty/bare repositories, and invalid commit references.
2.  Defined `tag list` subcommand:
    *   Lists all tags in the repository using `repo.listall_tags()`.
    *   Differentiates between "Annotated" and "Lightweight" tags.
    *   For annotated tags, displays the first line of the tag message.
    *   Displays the short ID of the target commit for each tag.
    *   Uses `rich.Table` for formatted output.
    *   Handles repositories with no tags.
3.  Implemented logic using `pygit2` for tag creation (both lightweight and annotated) and listing.
4.  Added comprehensive unit tests for both subcommands, covering various scenarios including different tag types, existing tags, repository states, and error conditions. All tests are passing.

---

## Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Refinement

### Task 4.1 - Develop Unit and Integration Tests
Objective: Create a comprehensive test suite for all CLI commands to ensure reliability and correctness.
Status: **Partially Completed / Ongoing**

1.  Set up testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
    - Comprehensive tests for `gitwrite revert` and `gitwrite init` have been successfully implemented and are passing. Testing for other commands is ongoing.
    - Tests for `gitwrite save` covering normal operations, merge conflicts, and revert conflicts have been implemented and are passing.
2.  Write unit tests for core logic of all implemented commands.
3.  Write integration tests for CLI commands, covering success cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
4.  Aim for high test coverage.

### Task 4.2 - Create User Documentation
Objective: Develop user-friendly documentation for the GitWrite CLI.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Outline documentation structure (Installation, Getting Started, Command Reference, Troubleshooting).
2.  Write content for each section.
3.  Choose documentation format (e.g., Markdown, static site generator).

### Task 4.3 - Refine CLI and Address Issues
Objective: Iterate on the CLI based on testing results and documentation process to improve usability and robustness.
Status: **Partially Completed / Ongoing**

1.  Fix known typo in `gitwrite sync` (`paciente=True`). - **DONE** (Typo not found, likely fixed previously or misreported).
2.  Fixed bug in `gitwrite init` where `repo.status_file()` was called with an absolute path for `.gitignore`, causing errors on subsequent runs. Changed to use a relative path. - **DONE**
3.  Review all test failures and bug reports.
4.  Enhance error handling and your feedback across all commands.
4.  Review CLI usability (command names, arguments, options, output clarity).
5.  Perform final round of integration testing.
    - **Completed:**
        - Fixed `test_revert_successful_merge_commit` to align with the `revert` command's current inability to revert merge commits directly (it now expects an error).
        - Fixed an issue in the `save` command where it wouldn't give the most specific error message if there were unresolved conflicts during a `revert` operation. It now correctly reports "Error: Unresolved conflicts detected during revert."

### Task 4.4 - Future Considerations / Known Limitations
Objective: Document known limitations and areas for future enhancement.
Status: **Ongoing**

1.  **`gitwrite revert <merge_commit_ref>` Command:**
    -   Currently, this command does not support reverting merge commits directly. The CLI will output an error message if a merge commit is targeted.
    -   **Future Enhancement:** True merge revert functionality (e.g., selecting a mainline parent to revert against) could be a significant future enhancement. This would likely require more complex logic than the current `pygit2.Repository.revert()` call used for simple commits, potentially involving direct manipulation of trees and commits, or exploring alternative library functions/versions if `pygit2` enhances this capability.

## Note on Handover Protocol

For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

`prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

The current Manager Agent or you should initiate this protocol as needed. Given the current blocker, this plan and the associated Memory Bank log serve as a handover document for the remaining tasks to the human developer.
