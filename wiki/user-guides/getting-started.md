## Understanding GitWrite Concepts

### Repositories
Think of a repository as a project folder that remembers every change you make. Each repository can contain:
- Text files (Markdown, plain text)
- Documents (Word, PDF)
- Images and other assets
- Organization folders

### Saving vs. Auto-save
- **Auto-save**: Continuously saves your work to prevent data loss
- **Save Changes**: Creates a permanent version with a description
- **History**: Shows all your saved versions

### Explorations (Branching)
Explorations let you try different approaches without affecting your main work:
- **Main**: Your primary version
- **Exploration**: A separate space to experiment
- **Merge**: Bring exploration changes back to main when ready

### Collaborations
Work together with different permission levels:
- **Owner**: Full control over repository
- **Editor**: Can edit content and manage collaborators
- **Writer**: Can create and edit content
- **Beta Reader**: Can read and provide feedback

## Your First Writing Session

### Setting Up Your Writing Environment

1. **Choose your editor**: GitWrite offers a distraction-free writing environment
2. **Customize settings**:
   - Font size and family
   - Dark/light theme
   - Auto-save frequency
   - Word count goals

3. **Set up your file structure**:
   ```
   my-novel/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outline.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ characters/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main-character.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supporting-cast.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter-01.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter-02.md
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ research/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ locations.md
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ timeline.md
   ```

### Writing Best Practices

1. **Save frequently with meaningful messages**:
   - ‚úÖ "Added character backstory and motivation"
   - ‚úÖ "Fixed plot hole in chapter 3"
   - ‚ùå "changes"
   - ‚ùå "update"

2. **Use explorations for major changes**:
   - Try different plot directions
   - Experiment with character development
   - Test alternative endings

3. **Organize your content**:
   - Use folders for different sections
   - Keep related files together
   - Use consistent naming conventions

### Daily Writing Workflow

1. **Start your session**:
   - Open your repository
   - Review yesterday's work
   - Set today's writing goal

2. **Write and save regularly**:
   - Focus on writing, not perfection
   - Save after completing scenes or sections
   - Use descriptive save messages

3. **End your session**:
   - Review your progress
   - Check word count statistics
   - Plan tomorrow's work

## Working with Different File Types

### Markdown (.md)
Markdown is GitWrite's preferred format for its simplicity and flexibility:

```markdown
# Chapter 1: The Beginning

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

> This is a quote or note.

- List item 1
- List item 2

[Link to character notes](characters/protagonist.md)
```

### Plain Text (.txt)
Simple text files work perfectly for:
- Quick notes
- Outlines
- Character sketches
- Research notes

### Importing Documents
You can import existing documents:
1. Click "Upload File"
2. Select your document (.docx, .pdf, etc.)
3. GitWrite will convert it to Markdown when possible

## Collaboration Basics

### Starting a Collaborative Project

1. **Create the repository** with clear structure
2. **Set up guidelines** in a README file:
   - Writing style preferences
   - File naming conventions
   - Collaboration workflow
3. **Invite team members** with appropriate roles
4. **Have a kickoff discussion** about goals and process

### Working with Others

1. **Communicate through annotations**:
   - Highlight text and add comments
   - Suggest specific changes
   - Ask questions about unclear sections

2. **Use explorations for major edits**:
   - Create named explorations for big changes
   - Let others review before merging
   - Discuss major direction changes

3. **Stay coordinated**:
   - Check recent activity before starting
   - Communicate what you're working on
   - Respect others' work and style

### Handling Feedback

1. **Review annotations regularly**
2. **Respond to questions and suggestions**
3. **Mark items as resolved when addressed**
4. **Discuss major changes before implementing**

## Version Management

### Understanding Your History

Every time you save, GitWrite creates a new version. You can:
- **View all versions** in the History tab
- **Compare versions** to see what changed
- **Restore old versions** if needed
- **Export any version** to different formats

### Working with Versions

1. **Compare versions**:
   - Select two versions to compare
   - See additions in green, deletions in red
   - Review change summaries

2. **Restore a previous version**:
   - Find the version you want in History
   - Click "Restore this version"
   - Add a save message explaining the restoration

3. **Tag important versions**:
   - Mark milestones (e.g., "First draft complete")
   - Create release versions (e.g., "v1.0 - Final submission")
   - Set reference points for major changes

1. **PDF**: Professional documents and manuscripts
2. **EPUB**: E-books for readers
