## Review Types and Workflows

### Content Review (Developmental Editing)

**Purpose**: Big-picture feedback on structure, plot, character development, and overall narrative flow.

**Workflow**:
1. **Writer submits** content for developmental review
2. **Editor creates exploration** for major structural changes
3. **Review focuses on**:
   - Story structure and pacing
   - Character development and consistency
   - Plot holes or logic issues
   - Theme and message clarity
   - Target audience alignment

**Best Practices**:
- Use explorations for major restructuring suggestions
- Focus on macro-level issues, not line editing
- Provide specific examples and suggestions
- Document rationale for major change recommendations

### Line Editing

**Purpose**: Sentence-level improvements for clarity, flow, and style while maintaining the author's voice.

**Workflow**:
1. **Editor receives** content marked for line editing
2. **Line-by-line review** using GitWrite's annotation system
3. **Focus areas**:
   - Sentence structure and flow
   - Word choice and clarity
   - Tone and voice consistency
   - Transitions between paragraphs
   - Readability improvements

**Annotation Example**:
```
Original: "The character was walking slowly down the street."
Suggestion: "The character ambled down the street."
Note: "More specific verb creates stronger imagery"
```

### Copy Editing

**Purpose**: Grammar, punctuation, spelling, and technical accuracy.

**Workflow**:
1. **Copy editor receives** near-final content
2. **Systematic review** for technical issues
3. **Check for**:
   - Grammar and punctuation errors
   - Spelling and typos
   - Consistency in style choices
   - Fact-checking requirements
   - Format compliance

### Proofreading

**Purpose**: Final check for any remaining errors before publication.

**Workflow**:
1. **Proofreader receives** formatted final version
2. **Final pass** for any missed errors
3. **Focus on**:
   - Remaining typos or formatting issues
   - Layout and design problems
   - Final fact-checking
   - Publication readiness

## Editorial Annotation System

### Creating Annotations

2. **Choose annotation type**:
   - **Comment**: General feedback or questions

   - **Flag**: Issues requiring attention

3. **Add detailed feedback**:

   - Reference style guides when applicable

### Annotation Categories

5. **Mark priority levels** for different issues

#### For Writers
