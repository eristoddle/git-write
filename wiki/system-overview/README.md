# System Overview

GitWrite is a comprehensive version control platform specifically designed for writers and writing teams. It bridges the gap between the powerful version control capabilities of Git and the accessibility needs of non-technical users in the writing industry.

## Project Mission

**Transform version control from a developer tool into a writer's companion.**

GitWrite abstracts the complexity of Git operations behind writer-friendly terminology and workflows, enabling authors, editors, beta readers, and publishers to collaborate effectively without needing to understand the underlying technical details.

## Core Problems Solved

### 1. Version Control Complexity
- **Problem**: Git's developer-centric interface is intimidating for writers
- **Solution**: Writer-friendly abstractions ("save" vs "commit", "explorations" vs "branches")

### 2. Collaboration Challenges
- **Problem**: Lack of structured feedback integration in writing workflows
- **Solution**: Built-in annotation system and role-based collaboration features

### 3. Multiple Draft Management
- **Problem**: Writers struggle to track and compare different versions of their work
- **Solution**: Intuitive branching system for exploring different narrative directions

### 4. Publishing Workflow Integration
- **Problem**: Disconnect between writing tools and publishing pipelines
- **Solution**: Export capabilities to multiple formats (EPUB, PDF, DOCX) via Pandoc

## System Functions

### Core Writing Operations
- **Initialize Projects**: `gitwrite init` - Set up new writing projects
- **Save Changes**: `gitwrite save` - Commit changes with meaningful descriptions
- **Create Explorations**: Alternative versions for experimentation
- **Compare Versions**: Word-level diff visualization
- **Track History**: Complete change history with rollback capabilities

### Collaboration Features
- **Role-Based Access**: Owners, editors, writers, and beta readers
- **Annotation System**: Structured feedback collection and integration
- **Cherry-Pick Reviews**: Selective integration of suggested changes
- **Merge Workflows**: Combine work from multiple contributors

### Export and Publishing
- **Multi-Format Export**: EPUB, PDF, DOCX generation via Pandoc
- **Manuscript Preparation**: Publishing-ready document formatting
- **Version Archiving**: Maintain complete project history

### Integration Capabilities
- **REST API**: Programmatic access for third-party tools
- **TypeScript SDK**: Easy integration for JavaScript/TypeScript applications
- **Git Compatibility**: Full interoperability with existing Git workflows

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Authors**: Individual writers working on books, articles, or other long-form content
- **Writing Teams**: Collaborative groups working on shared projects
- **Editors**: Professional editors providing structured feedback
- **Publishers**: Organizations managing multiple writing projects

### Secondary Users
- **Beta Readers**: Volunteers providing feedback during development
- **Writing Tool Developers**: Third-party applications integrating GitWrite functionality
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities teaching writing

## Technical Foundation

GitWrite is built on a solid technical foundation that ensures reliability, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Git Core**: Leverages libgit2/pygit2 for robust version control operations
- **Multi-Interface Design**: CLI, Web UI, Mobile app, and API access
- **Modern Web Stack**: React/TypeScript frontend with FastAPI backend
- **Container-Ready**: Docker support for easy deployment
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for both local and cloud-based operations

## Success Metrics

GitWrite's success is measured by:
- **Adoption Rate**: Number of active writing projects
- **User Retention**: Writers continuing to use the platform
- **Collaboration Volume**: Multi-user projects and feedback cycles
- **Export Usage**: Documents successfully published through GitWrite
- **Community Growth**: Third-party integrations and extensions
