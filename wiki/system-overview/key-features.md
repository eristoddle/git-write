## 🌿 Branching as Explorations

### Writer-Friendly Branching
GitWrite transforms Git's branching concept into "explorations" - alternative versions of your work that you can experiment with safely.

### Use Cases
- **Alternative Endings**: Explore different conclusions to your story
- **Character Development**: Try different character arcs or personalities
- **Narrative Structure**: Experiment with different story structures
- **Tone Variations**: Test different writing styles or voices

### Features
- **Easy Creation**: `gitwrite explore create "alternative-ending"`
- **Safe Switching**: `gitwrite explore switch "character-development"`
- **Comparison Tools**: Visual comparison between explorations
- **Selective Merging**: Choose the best parts from different explorations

### Exploration Workflow
```
Main Story
├── exploration/alternative-ending
├── exploration/first-person-narrative
└── exploration/darker-tone
```
