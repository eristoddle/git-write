# Implementation Plan: GitWrite Platform

Project Goal: Develop a comprehensive, Git-based version control ecosystem for writers, starting with a core library, a CLI, and a REST API.

## General Project Notes
*   **Memory Bank System:** Single file `Memory_Bank.md`.
*   **Architectural Goal:** A central `gitwrite_core` library will contain all business logic. The `gitwrite_cli` and `gitwrite_api` will be thin wrappers around this core library.

---
## Phase 1-4: CLI Refactoring
Status: **Completed**
Summary: All tasks related to refactoring the CLI application and establishing the `gitwrite_core` library have been successfully completed. The project is ready for the next epic.

---

## Phase 5: REST API Development
Status: **Completed**
Architectural Notes: The API was built using FastAPI and containerized with Docker. It uses a two-step upload process to handle large files securely and efficiently, preventing API server bottlenecks.

### Task 5.1 - Agent_API_Dev: Initial API and Docker Setup
Objective: Create the `gitwrite_api` directory, set up the basic FastAPI application, and create a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
Status: **Completed**

### Task 5.2 - Agent_API_Dev: Implement Security and Authentication
Objective: Set up JWT-based authentication and basic security helpers.
Status: **Completed**

### Task 5.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Implement Read-Only Repository Endpoints
Objective: Create secure endpoints for non-mutating operations to validate the API structure.
Status: **Completed**

### Task 5.4 - Agent_API_Dev: Design and Implement Large File Upload Strategy
Objective: Implement the two-step upload mechanism to handle large files.
Status: **Completed**

### Task 5.5 - Agent_API_Dev: Implement the `save` Endpoint Logic
Objective: Connect the upload mechanism to the core `save_changes` function.
Status: **Completed**

## Phase 6: TypeScript SDK Development
Status: **Pending**
Architectural Notes:
*   **Location:** The SDK will be developed in a new, top-level directory: `gitwrite_sdk/`. This keeps the TypeScript project and its tooling (`package.json`, etc.) separate from the Python components.
*   **Technology:** The SDK will be a TypeScript-first library, packaged for use in both Node.js and browser environments. It will use a modern build toolchain and provide a clean, promise-based API that mirrors the REST API's functionality.

### Task 6.1 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Initial SDK Setup & Project Configuration
Objective: Set up the project structure, dependencies, and build configuration for the TypeScript SDK.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a new directory `gitwrite_sdk/` at the project root.
2.  Initialize a `package.json` file. Add dependencies like `axios` (for HTTP requests) and dev dependencies like `typescript`, `jest` (or `vitest`), `ts-jest`, and a bundler like `rollup` or `vite`.
3.  Create a `tsconfig.json` file with appropriate settings for library development (e.g., declaration file generation).
4.  Set up the build scripts in `package.json` to compile TypeScript and generate different module formats (e.g., ESM, CJS).

### Task 6.2 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Implement Authentication and API Client
Objective: Create a base API client to handle authentication and requests to the GitWrite API.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Create a main client class (e.g., `GitWriteClient`).
2.  Implement methods for authentication (`login`, `logout`, `setToken`). The client should store the JWT and automatically include it in subsequent requests.
3.  Create a thin wrapper around `axios` to handle base URL configuration, headers, and error handling for API responses.

### Task 6.3 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Implement Read-Only Repository Methods
Objective: Create SDK methods for read-only repository operations.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Create a `repository` module or property on the main client.
2.  Implement `repository.listBranches()`, `repository.listTags()`, and `repository.listCommits(options)`.
3.  These methods will call the corresponding endpoints on the API (`/repository/branches`, etc.) using the base API client.
4.  Define TypeScript interfaces for the response data to ensure type safety.

### Task 6.4 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Implement `save` Method
Objective: Create an SDK method for the direct save functionality.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Implement a `repository.save(filePath, content, commitMessage)` method.
2.  This method will call the `POST /repository/save` endpoint.
3.  Define TypeScript interfaces for the request and response bodies.

### Task 6.5 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Implement Multi-Part Upload Methods
Objective: Create a high-level SDK method to simplify the two-step upload process.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Design a method like `repository.saveFiles(files, commitMessage)`.
2.  `files` would be an array of objects, each containing a file path and its content (e.g., as a `Blob` or `Buffer`).
3.  This method will internally handle the entire workflow:
    -   (Optional, client-side) Calculate file hashes.
    -   Call the `/initiate` endpoint.
    -   Use the returned URLs to upload each file's content in parallel.
    -   Once all uploads are complete, call the `/complete` endpoint with the token.
4.  Return a promise that resolves with the final commit ID upon success.

### Task 6.6 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Add Unit and Integration Tests
Objective: Ensure the SDK is reliable and correctly interacts with the API.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Set up the chosen testing framework (Jest/Vitest).
2.  Write unit tests for individual methods, mocking the API client (`axios`) to test logic in isolation.
3.  (Optional but recommended) Write integration tests that run against a live instance of the GitWrite API (e.g., running in Docker).

### Task 6.7 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Documentation and Packaging
Objective: Prepare the SDK for consumption by other developers.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Add TSDoc comments to all public classes and methods.
2.  Create a `README.md` file within the `gitwrite_sdk/` directory explaining how to install and use the SDK.
3.  Configure the `package.json` with all necessary fields for publishing to a package registry like npm.

## Note on Handover Protocol

For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

`prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

The current Manager Agent or you should initiate this protocol as needed.
