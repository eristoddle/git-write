# Implementation Plan: GitWrite Platform

Project Goal: Develop a comprehensive, Git-based version control ecosystem for writers, with a core library, a CLI, a feature-complete REST API, and a client-side SDK.

## General Project Notes
*   **Memory Bank System:** Single file `Memory_Bank.md`.
*   **Architectural Goal:** The `gitwrite_api` will achieve feature parity with the `gitwrite_cli`. The `TypeScript SDK` will then be built as a wrapper around the completed API.

---
## Phase 1-5: Core, CLI, and Initial API Setup
Status: **Completed**
Summary: All tasks related to the core library, CLI, and initial API setup are complete. The project is now focused on exposing all remaining core features via the API.

---

## Phase 6: API Feature Parity with CLI
Status: **Pending**
Architectural Notes: This phase will create API endpoints for all remaining user-facing features available in the CLI. Each new endpoint will be a thin wrapper around its corresponding core function and must include authentication and appropriate error handling.

### Task 6.1 - Agent_API_Dev: Branching Endpoints
Objective: Expose core branching functionalities (`create`, `switch`) via the API.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a `POST /repository/branches` endpoint that takes a `branch_name` and calls `gitwrite_core.branching.create_and_switch_branch`.
2.  Create a `PUT /repository/branch` endpoint that takes a `branch_name` to switch to, calling `gitwrite_core.branching.switch_to_branch`.
3.  Add comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_api_repository.py` for the new branching endpoints.

### Task 6.2 - Agent_API_Dev: Merge and Compare Endpoints
Objective: Expose `merge` and `compare` functionalities.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a `POST /repository/merges` endpoint that takes a `source_branch` name and calls `gitwrite_core.branching.merge_branch_into_current`. It must handle success, fast-forward, and conflict states.
2.  Create a `GET /repository/compare` endpoint that takes two references (`ref1`, `ref2`) and calls `gitwrite_core.versioning.get_diff`.
3.  Add unit tests for both `merge` and `compare` endpoints.

### Task 6.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Revert and Sync Endpoints
Objective: Expose `revert` and `sync` functionalities.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a `POST /repository/revert` endpoint that takes a `commit_ish` and calls `gitwrite_core.versioning.revert_commit`.
2.  Create a `POST /repository/sync` endpoint that calls `gitwrite_core.repository.sync_repository` and accepts optional parameters.
3.  Add unit tests for both `revert` and `sync` endpoints.

### Task 6.4 - Agent_API_Dev: Tagging Endpoints
Objective: Add the ability to create tags via the API.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a `POST /repository/tags` endpoint that takes `name`, `message` (optional), `commit_ish` (optional), and `force` (optional) and calls `gitwrite_core.tagging.create_tag`.
2.  Add unit tests for the new tag creation endpoint.

### Task 6.5 - Agent_API_Dev: Ignore Management Endpoints
Objective: Expose `.gitignore` management functionality.
Status: **Completed**

1.  Create a `GET /repository/ignore` endpoint that calls `gitwrite_core.repository.list_gitignore_patterns`.
2.  Create a `POST /repository/ignore` endpoint that takes a `pattern` and calls `gitwrite_core.repository.add_pattern_to_gitignore`.
3.  Add unit tests for both `.gitignore` management endpoints.

### Task 6.6 - Agent_API_Dev: Finalize Multi-File Upload Logic
Objective: Connect the two-step upload mechanism to a core function that can commit multiple files at once.
Status: **Pending**

1.  Create a new core function `save_and_commit_multiple_files(repo_path_str: str, files_to_commit: Dict[str, str], ...)` in `gitwrite_core.repository`. It will take a dictionary mapping the destination relative path to the temporary file path on the server.
2.  Update the `POST /repositories/{repo_id}/save/complete` endpoint in `gitwrite_api/routers/uploads.py` to call this new core function.
3.  Ensure that upon successful commit, all temporary files for the session are deleted.
4.  Update unit tests in `tests/test_api_uploads.py` to reflect these changes.

---

## Phase 7: TypeScript SDK Development
Status: **On Hold**
Architectural Notes: This phase will commence after the successful completion and stabilization of the Phase 6 API. The SDK will provide a clean, typed interface for frontend developers to interact with all API endpoints.

### Task 7.1 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Initial SDK Setup
Objective: Set up the TypeScript project, build system, and basic client structure.
Status: **Pending**

### Task 7.2 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Implement API Wrappers
Objective: Create methods in the SDK to wrap all endpoints defined and implemented in Phase 6.
Status: **Pending**

## Note on Handover Protocol

For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

`prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

The current Manager Agent or you should initiate this protocol as needed.
