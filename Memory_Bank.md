**Agent:** Manager Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Project State Summary at Blocker - CLI MVP (Steps 1-7 of original plan)

**Summary:**
The GitWrite CLI MVP development has progressed through the implementation of core features including `init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, and `compare`. The `sync` command is also implemented but has a known minor display typo. Further CLI development (notably `revert` command), along with comprehensive AI-driven testing and documentation, is currently blocked by a persistent environment error. Code up to the `sync` command has been committed to the `cli-mvp-features` branch.

**Details:**
- **Implemented Commands:**
    - `gitwrite init [project_name]`: Initializes project structure.
    - `gitwrite save "message"`: Stages changes and commits; handles merge commit finalization.
    - `gitwrite history [-n count]`: Displays formatted commit history.
    - `gitwrite explore <branch_name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
    - `gitwrite switch [<branch_name>]`: Switches to an existing branch or lists branches.
    - `gitwrite merge <branch_name>`: Merges branches, handling fast-forwards, normal merges, and conflicts (manual resolution + `gitwrite save`).
    - `gitwrite compare [ref1] [ref2]`: Displays word-level diff.
    - `gitwrite sync [--remote <remote>] [--branch <branch>]`: Fetches, pulls/merges, and pushes changes.
- **Decision Point:** Due to a persistent environment error (`ValueError: ... cat: /app/...: Is a directory`) preventing file modifications, I halted AI-driven development. You directed me to commit existing work and document the state.
- **Code Committed:** All implemented features (up to `sync`) have been committed to the `cli-mvp-features` branch.

**Output/Result:**
- **Committed Code:** Branch `cli-mvp-features` in the repository contains the implemented CLI features.
- **Known Typo:** In `gitwrite_cli/main.py`, within the `sync` command, an informational `click.echo` statement has `paciente=True` instead of `err=False`.

**Status:** Blocked

**Issues/Blockers:**
- **Primary Blocker:** Persistent environment error (`ValueError: ... cat: /app/...: Is a directory`) prevents any file creation or modification, thus halting further AI-driven development, testing, and documentation tasks.
- **Incomplete Original Plan Items (due to blocker):**
    - Step 8: Implement `gitwrite revert`
    - Step 9: Develop Unit and Integration Tests
    - Step 10: Create User Documentation
    - Step 11: Refine CLI and Address Issues
    - Step 12: Create `Memory_Bank.md` file - This log entry serves as the content for it.
    - Step 13: Add Memory Bank and Handover Protocol notes to `Implementation_Plan.md` - Notes are captured here and in the plan structure.
    - Step 14: Finalize the initial CLI application - Partially done by committing current progress.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- **Your Action:**
    1.  Create/Update `Memory_Bank.md` with this log entry.
    2.  Investigate and resolve the environment error.
    3.  If environment error cannot be resolved quickly for me:
        *   You may need to take over implementation of `gitwrite revert`.
        *   You may need to fix the typo in `gitwrite sync`.
        *   You may need to conduct comprehensive testing for all CLI commands.
        *   You may need to create user documentation.
        *   You may need to perform final CLI refinement.
- **My Action:** Awaiting your guidance on the environment issue or alternative approach.
