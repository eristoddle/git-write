**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Review and Forward Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a full review of the project state by comparing the `Implementation_Plan.md`, `Memory_Bank.md`, and the `writegit-project-doc.md`. While all tasks in the previous plan are complete, significant features from the project documentation are still missing. The implementation plan has been updated to address these gaps and create a clear path forward.

**Details:**
-   **Analysis:** The project has successfully implemented core functionalities, a CLI, a feature-rich API, and a corresponding SDK. The initial version of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has also been implemented.
-   **Identified Gaps:** Key features from the project documentation remain unimplemented. These include:
    1.  **Advanced Word-by-Word Diff as a Core Feature:** The current word-diff implementation is confined to the CLI's display logic. It needs to be refactored into a reusable core function and exposed via the API to support future web interfaces.
    2.  **Beta Reader Annotation Workflow:** The core logic for receiving, storing, and applying annotations from an EPUB reader is missing. This is a critical part of `FR-006`.
    3.  **Web Application & Mobile Application:** These major frontend components have not been started.
-   **New Plan:** A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated. It marks phases 1-9 as complete and introduces new phases for the remaining work, starting with enhancing the core/API features before tackling the UIs.

**Output/Result:**
-   Generated new `Implementation_Plan.md`.
-   Generated this log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Generated the prompt for the next agent session.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the first task of the new plan: **Task 10.1 - Core Word-by-Word Diff Engine**.

**Task Reference:** Task 10.1 - Agent_Core_Dev: Core Word-by-Word Diff Engine

**Summary:**
Successfully refactored the word-by-word diff logic from the CLI into a reusable core function and exposed it through an enhanced API endpoint. This enables a structured JSON representation of word-level differences, paving the way for a rich visual diff experience in the future web application.

**Details:**
1.  **Core Function (`gitwrite_core/versioning.py`):**
    *   Created a new function `get_word_level_diff(patch_text: str) -> List[Dict]`.
    *   This function parses a standard diff patch string.
    *   It adapts logic from `gitwrite_cli/main.py::process_hunk_lines_for_word_diff` but returns a structured JSON-serializable list of dictionaries instead of printing to the console.
    *   The returned structure delineates added, removed, and context parts at both line and word levels (e.g., `[{"file_path": "a.txt", "change_type": "modified", "hunks": [{"lines": [...]}]}]`).

2.  **API Endpoint (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    *   Modified the existing `GET /repository/compare` endpoint.
    *   Added an optional query parameter `diff_mode: Optional[str]`.
    *   If `diff_mode='word'`, the endpoint now calls `get_word_level_diff` and returns the structured JSON.
    *   Otherwise, it maintains its current behavior (raw patch text).
    *   Updated the `CompareRefsResponse` Pydantic model's `patch_text` field to `Union[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]` to support both response types.

3.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   Added new unit tests for `get_word_level_diff` in `tests/test_core_versioning.py`, covering various scenarios like additions, deletions, modifications, multiple files/hunks, empty patches, and renamed files.
    *   Updated unit tests for `GET /repository/compare` in `tests/test_api_repository.py` to cover both standard text-based diff and the new word-level structured diff via the `diff_mode` parameter.

**Output/Result:**
-   Core word-by-word diff engine implemented in `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`.
-   `GET /repository/compare` API endpoint enhanced to support word-level diffs.
-   `CompareRefsResponse` model updated.
-   Comprehensive unit tests added for the new core function and updated API endpoint.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 10.1 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 10.2 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 10.2 - Agent_Core_Dev: Core Annotation Handling

**Summary:**
Designed and implemented the core logic for creating, listing, and updating annotations. Each annotation and its status changes are stored as structured commits on a dedicated feedback branch, aligning with Git-native principles.

**Details:**
1.  **Data Model (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    *   Defined `AnnotationStatus` enum (`NEW`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`).
    *   Defined `Annotation` Pydantic model with fields: `id`, `file_path`, `highlighted_text`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `comment`, `author`, `status`, `commit_id`, and `original_annotation_id`.

2.  **Core Module (`gitwrite_core/annotations.py`):**
    *   Created the new module for all annotation-related logic.
    *   Implemented `_run_git_command` helper using `subprocess` for Git interactions.
    *   Added `AnnotationError` and `RepositoryOperationError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.

3.  **Annotation Committing (`create_annotation_commit`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path`, `feedback_branch`, and `Annotation` data.
    *   Ensures feedback branch exists (creates if not, based on current HEAD).
    *   Serializes annotation data (excluding `id`, `commit_id`) to YAML.
    *   Creates a new, empty Git commit (`--allow-empty`) on the feedback branch.
    *   Commit message: `Annotation: {file_path} (Lines {start_line}-{end_line})`.
    *   YAML data is stored in the commit body.
    *   Returns the SHA of the new annotation commit.
    *   Updates the input `Annotation` object's `id` and `commit_id` with the new SHA.

4.  **Annotation Listing (`list_annotations`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path` and `feedback_branch`.
    *   Parses `git log` output from the feedback branch (oldest to newest).
    *   Extracts YAML from commit message bodies.
    *   Reconstructs `Annotation` objects.
    *   Handles status update commits: If a commit updates a previous annotation (via `original_annotation_id` in its YAML), the function ensures the final list reflects the latest status and data for that annotation thread.
    *   The `id` of a listed `Annotation` is always the SHA of its original creation commit.
    *   The `commit_id` of a listed `Annotation` is the SHA of the commit that defines its current state (original or latest update).
    *   The `original_annotation_id` field in the `Annotation` model is populated if the annotation state comes from an update commit.
    *   Returns a `List[Annotation]`.

5.  **Status Updates (`update_annotation_status`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path`, `feedback_branch`, `annotation_commit_id` (SHA of the original annotation), and `new_status`.
    *   Retrieves the data from the original annotation commit.
    *   Creates a new commit on the feedback branch.
    *   Commit message: `Update status: {file_path} (Annotation {short_orig_sha}) to {new_status}`.
    *   YAML body of this new commit includes all data from the original annotation, the `new_status`, and an `original_annotation_id` field pointing to the `annotation_commit_id` being updated.
    *   Returns the SHA of the status update commit.

6.  **Unit Tests (`tests/test_core_annotations.py`):**
    *   Created a new test file.
    *   Added `temp_git_repo` and `temp_empty_git_repo` pytest fixtures.
    *   Implemented comprehensive tests for `create_annotation_commit`, `list_annotations` (including handling of updates and non-annotation commits), and `update_annotation_status`.
    *   Covered success cases, error handling (e.g., invalid repo, non-existent branches/commits, malformed data), and edge cases (e.g., creating annotations in an empty repository).

**Output/Result:**
-   Core annotation handling logic implemented in `gitwrite_core/annotations.py`.
-   Pydantic models for annotations defined in `gitwrite_api/models.py`.
-   Custom exceptions added to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
-   Comprehensive unit tests created in `tests/test_core_annotations.py`.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 10.2 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 10.3 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
