**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Project Refactoring Strategy

**Summary:**
Initiating a strategic refactoring of the GitWrite CLI project. The primary goal is to separate the core Git logic from the command-line interface implementation. This will be achieved by creating a new `gitwrite_core` library to house all business logic, making the existing `gitwrite_cli` a thin presentation layer.

**Details:**
- **Problem:** The current project structure in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` tightly couples the core logic (interactions with `pygit2`) with the presentation logic (`click` commands). This is perfectly fine for an MVP but presents challenges for future development, specifically for the planned REST API, which would require duplicating code or creating a messy dependency on the CLI module.
- **Solution:** A new `gitwrite_core` package will be created. All complex logic will be moved into functions within this library. These functions will be designed to be pure and reusable: they will take parameters, perform actions, and either return data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) or raise specific, custom exceptions (e.g., `CommitNotFoundError`).
- **Benefit:** This "Separation of Concerns" will make the code more modular, easier to test, and crucially, allows both the `gitwrite_cli` and the future `gitwrite_api` to use the same robust, tested `gitwrite_core` library without code duplication.
- **Process:** The refactoring will be done incrementally, command by command, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`, to ensure the project remains in a working state throughout the process.

**Output/Result:**
- A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated to guide the refactoring effort.
- This `Memory_Bank.md` entry has been created to log the strategic decision and rationale.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.1 of the new Implementation Plan: setting up the `gitwrite_core` project structure.

**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.1: Project Structure and Core Files Setup

**Summary:**
Completed the setup of the foundational directory structure and files for the `gitwrite_core` library. This is the first step in refactoring the core Git logic out of the CLI.

**Details:**
The following files and directory were created:
- `gitwrite_core/` (directory)
- `gitwrite_core/__init__.py` (file)
- `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` (file with custom exception classes)
- `gitwrite_core/repository.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/branching.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/tagging.py` (file, empty)

**Output/Result:**
The necessary file structure for the `gitwrite_core` library is now in place.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.2, which involves moving the first piece of logic (e.g., repository initialization or status checking) into the new `gitwrite_core` library.

**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.2: Refactor `init` and `ignore` commands
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of `init` and `ignore` commands. Core logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/repository.py`. CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers. Tests were refactored into unit tests for core logic and integration tests for CLI interaction.
**Details:**
 - **`init` command:**
   - Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository(path_str, project_name=None)`.
   - CLI `init` command now calls this core function and handles output.
   - Tests refactored: `TestInitializeRepositoryCore` for unit tests, `TestGitWriteInit` for CLI integration.
 - **`ignore` command (add & list):**
   - Logic for `add` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.add_pattern_to_gitignore(repo_path_str, pattern)`.
   - Logic for `list` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.list_gitignore_patterns(repo_path_str)`.
   - CLI `ignore add` and `ignore list` commands call these core functions.
   - Tests refactored: `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions` for unit tests, existing CLI tests adapted for integration.
**Output/Result:**
 - `gitwrite_core/repository.py` now contains `initialize_repository`, `add_pattern_to_gitignore`, and `list_gitignore_patterns`.
 - `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `init`, `ignore add`, `ignore list` commands are wrappers.
 - `tests/test_main.py` updated with new unit test classes (`TestInitializeRepositoryCore`, `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions`) and refactored CLI tests.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Proceed with Phase 2, Task 2.1: Refactor `tag` Command.
---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 2, Task 2.1: Refactor `tag` Command
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of the `tag` command. Core logic for creating and listing tags was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/tagging.py`. The CLI `tag add` and `tag list` commands were updated to be thin wrappers around these core functions. Tests were significantly refactored to include comprehensive unit tests for the new core logic and focused integration tests for the CLI.
**Details:**
 - **Core Logic (`gitwrite_core/tagging.py`):**
   - Added `create_tag(repo_path_str, tag_name, target_commit_ish='HEAD', message=None, force=False)`: Handles creation of both lightweight and annotated tags, including force overwrite and error handling (e.g., `TagAlreadyExistsError`, `CommitNotFoundError`). Returns a dictionary with tag details.
   - Added `list_tags(repo_path_str)`: Lists all tags in a repository, returning a list of dictionaries containing tag name, type (lightweight/annotated), target commit OID, and message (for annotated tags).
   - Added `TagAlreadyExistsError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
 - **CLI Updates (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
   - The `tag add` command now calls `gitwrite_core.tagging.create_tag` and handles its output and exceptions.
   - The `tag list` command now calls `gitwrite_core.tagging.list_tags` and uses `rich.Table` to display the returned data.
 - **Test Updates (`tests/test_main.py`):**
   - Added `TestTaggingCore`: A new unit test class with comprehensive tests for `create_tag` and `list_tags`, covering various scenarios and error conditions.
   - Added `TestTagCommandsCLI`: A new integration test class for the `gitwrite tag add` and `gitwrite tag list` CLI commands, ensuring correct interaction with the core library and proper CLI output/error handling.
**Output/Result:**
 - `gitwrite_core/tagging.py` now contains the `create_tag` and `list_tags` functions.
 - `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` includes the new `TagAlreadyExistsError`.
 - `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `tag add` and `tag list` commands are now thin wrappers.
 - `tests/test_main.py` has been updated with new test classes `TestTaggingCore` and `TestTagCommandsCLI` for improved testing of tag functionality.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Proceed with Phase 2, Task 2.2: Refactor `history` and `compare` Commands.
