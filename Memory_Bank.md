**Agent:** Manager Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Project State Summary - CLI MVP

**Summary:**
The GitWrite CLI MVP development has progressed through the implementation of core features including `init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, and `sync`. The `revert` command has now also been implemented and tested. Some minor issues (e.g., `sync` typo) are noted.

**Details:**
- **Implemented Commands:**
    - `gitwrite init [project_name]`: Initializes project structure.
    - `gitwrite save "message"`: Stages changes and commits; handles merge and revert commit finalization.
    - `gitwrite history [-n count]`: Displays formatted commit history.
    - `gitwrite explore <branch_name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
    - `gitwrite switch [<branch_name>]`: Switches to an existing branch or lists branches.
    - `gitwrite merge <branch_name>`: Merges branches, handling fast-forwards, normal merges, and conflicts (manual resolution + `gitwrite save`).
    - `gitwrite compare [ref1] [ref2]`: Displays word-level diff.
    - `gitwrite sync [--remote <remote>] [--branch <branch>]`: Fetches, pulls/merges, and pushes changes.
    - `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]`: Reverts specified commit (non-merge commits fully supported; merge commits have limitations).
- **Code Committed:**
    - Features up to `sync` were on `cli-mvp-features`.
    - The `revert` command and its tests were developed on the `feature/revert-command` branch. (This will be merged to main or the relevant feature branch).

**Output/Result:**
- **Committed Code:** Branch `feature/revert-command` contains the `revert` feature. Other features are on `cli-mvp-features` or merged to main.
- **Known Typo:** In `gitwrite_cli/main.py`, within the `sync` command, an informational `click.echo` statement has `paciente=True` instead of `err=False`.
- **Identified Limitation:** `gitwrite revert` cannot perform index-only reverts of merge commits with specific mainline parent selection due to underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` behavior in v1.18.0; CLI now errors gracefully for this case.

**Status:** Active Development / Ready for Next Task

**Issues/Blockers (Current):**
- No major environment blockers encountered during `revert` implementation.

**Completed Original Plan Items (Previously Blocked):**
- Step 8: Implement `gitwrite revert` - **DONE** (with noted limitations for merge commits)
- Step 9: Develop Unit and Integration Tests (for `revert`) - **DONE**
- Unit and Integration Tests (for `sync`, `ignore`, `tag`) - **DONE**

**Remaining Original Plan Items (Adjusted):**
- Comprehensive testing for remaining CLI commands (`init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`).
- Address `sync` command typo.
- Step 10: Create User Documentation.
- Step 11: Refine CLI and Address Issues (e.g., review `revert` merge limitations for future improvement if library changes).
- Step 12: Update `Memory_Bank.md` file - This log entry. (Ongoing)
- Step 13: Add Memory Bank and Handover Protocol notes to `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Step 14: Finalize the initial CLI application.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- **Your Action:**
    - Review and merge `feature/revert-command`.
    - Prioritize next development tasks (e.g., typo fix, documentation, broader testing).
- **My Action:** Awaiting your guidance.

**Update: `gitwrite revert` Implementation and Testing**

The `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]` command has been successfully implemented and tested.

**Key Features & Details:**
-   **Non-Merge Commits:** Successfully reverts non-merge commits. A new commit is created with a standard message format (e.g., "Revert '[original commit message]'"), and the working directory reflects the undone changes.
-   **Conflict Handling:** If a revert attempt results in conflicts, the command updates the index with conflict markers and creates `REVERT_HEAD`. It then instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts and use `gitwrite save "message"` to complete the revert.
-   **`gitwrite save` Enhancement:** The `save` command was updated to detect the presence of `REVERT_HEAD`. If found, it automatically prepends the standard "Revert '[original commit message]'" to the user's provided save message, ensuring clear commit history for resolved reverts. It also correctly cleans up `REVERT_HEAD` (and `MERGE_HEAD` if applicable) via `repo.state_cleanup()`.
-   **Merge Commit Reverts (Limitation Identified):**
    *   During development, it was discovered that `pygit2.Repository.revert()` (version 1.18.0, as installed in the environment) does not reliably support specifying a mainline parent for merge commits when the goal is to *only update the index* (as opposed to directly creating the revert commit). Attempts to pass `mainline` as a keyword or positional argument led to various `TypeError` or specific errors from `libgit2` (e.g., "mainline branch is not specified..."). `RevertOptions` was also found to be not directly importable from `pygit2` in this version.
    *   Consequently, the `gitwrite revert` command now detects if the target commit is a merge commit. If so, it informs the user that this specific operation (index-only revert of a merge commit, especially with mainline selection) is not supported with the current underlying library method and fails gracefully with an error message. The `--mainline` option is therefore only relevant for informational purposes if a future `pygit2` version or method allows it.
-   **Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `revert` command were added to `tests/test_main.py`.
    *   Scenarios covered include: successful non-merge reverts, reverting an initial commit, reverting a revert commit, attempts to revert with a dirty working directory, invalid commit references, and handling of conflicts (including resolution via `gitwrite save`).
    *   The merge commit revert test was updated to assert that the CLI now correctly identifies merge commits and informs the user of the current limitation.
    *   All 12 tests in the suite are currently passing.
-   **Dependencies:** Python package dependencies (`click`, `pygit2==1.18.0`, `rich`, `pytest`) were installed and utilized during development and testing.

This work effectively completes the `revert` command implementation as per the original plan, within the constraints discovered with the `pygit2` library.
