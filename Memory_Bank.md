**Task Reference:** Finalize Refactoring Epic and Plan Next Epic

**Summary:**
The CLI refactoring epic is now complete. All core logic has been successfully moved to the `gitwrite_core` library, and the codebase has been reviewed and cleaned. The project is now ready to begin the next major phase: the development of the REST API.

**Details:**
- **Refactoring Complete:** All tasks in Phases 1 through 4 of the `Implementation_Plan.md` are now marked as "Completed".
- **Next Epic - REST API:** A new "Phase 5: REST API Development" has been added to the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- **Technical Decisions for API:**
  - **Framework:** FastAPI
  - **Security:** JWT for authentication.
  - **Deployment:** Containerization via Docker for platform-agnostic deployment.
  - **Structure:** A new `gitwrite_api/` directory will be created at the project root and managed by the central `pyproject.toml`, ensuring proper use of the `gitwrite_core` library.
- **Large File Handling:** Acknowledged the risk of large commits over HTTP. The API will implement a two-step upload process (initiate, upload, complete) to handle large files securely and efficiently, preventing API server bottlenecks. This design is reflected in the new tasks for Phase 5.
- The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been updated with a detailed, actionable plan for building the API.

**Output/Result:**
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- This log entry.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 5, Task 5.1: Initial API and Docker Setup.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.3: Agent_API_Dev: Implement Read-Only Repository Endpoints

**Summary:**
Completed the implementation of read-only repository-related API endpoints. This involved adding core Git logic functions, creating a new API router, defining the endpoints, and adding corresponding unit tests.

**Details:**
- **Core Functions Added to `gitwrite_core/repository.py`**:
    - `list_branches(repo_path_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists local branches.
    - `list_tags(repo_path_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists tags.
    - `list_commits(repo_path_str: str, branch_name: Optional[str] = None, max_count: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists commits for a branch (or current HEAD), with optional filtering.
- **New API Router**: Created `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py` to handle repository-specific API calls.
- **Implemented Endpoints**:
    - `GET /repository/branches`: Lists all branches.
    - `GET /repository/tags`: Lists all tags.
    - `GET /repository/commits`: Lists commits, accepting optional query parameters `branch_name` (string) and `max_count` (integer).
- **Authentication**: All new endpoints require authentication (currently using a placeholder `get_current_active_user` dependency).
- **Repository Path**: A placeholder `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH` is used in the router, indicating a need for dynamic path determination in future tasks.
- **Unit Tests**: Added `tests/test_api_repository.py` with Pytest tests covering successful responses, unauthorized access (mocked), query parameter handling, and error scenarios by mocking core function return values.
- **Branch**: All development for this task was done on the branch `feature/api-readonly-repo-endpoints`.
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` to mark Task 5.3 as "Completed".

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `gitwrite_core/repository.py` (added new functions)
- New file: `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/main.py` (included new router)
- New file: `tests/test_api_repository.py`
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 5.3 status updated)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None identified. The placeholder for repository path and authentication are known items for future refinement as per the overall plan.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the next planned task in Phase 5.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.4: Design and Implement Large File Upload Strategy

**Summary:**
Successfully designed and implemented the initial phase of the large file upload strategy for the API. This includes endpoints for initiating an upload, handling individual file uploads, and completing the upload process (currently with a simulated commit). Core Git operations are deferred to Task 5.5.

**Details:**
- Created Pydantic models in `gitwrite_api/models.py` for upload API requests and responses: `FileMetadata`, `FileUploadInitiateRequest`, `FileUploadInitiateResponse`, `FileUploadCompleteRequest`, `FileUploadCompleteResponse`.
- Created `gitwrite_api/routers/uploads.py`, which defines two `APIRouter` instances:
    - `router`: Handles prefixed routes `/repositories/{repo_id}/save/` for initiation and completion.
        - Implemented `POST /repositories/{repo_id}/save/initiate`: Accepts file metadata, generates unique upload URLs for each file, and returns a completion token. Manages session state in an in-memory dictionary (`upload_sessions`).
        - Implemented `POST /repositories/{repo_id}/save/complete`: Accepts a completion token, verifies all files are uploaded, and currently simulates a commit. Actual Git operations and cleanup are part of Task 5.5.
    - `session_upload_router`: Handles the non-prefixed route for individual file uploads.
        - Implemented `PUT /upload-session/{upload_id}`: Receives raw file data, streams it to a temporary file in `TEMP_UPLOAD_DIR`, and updates session state.
- Integrated both `uploads.router` and `uploads.session_upload_router` into the main FastAPI application in `gitwrite_api/main.py`.
- Developed a comprehensive suite of unit tests in `tests/test_api_uploads.py` using `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`, covering success paths, error conditions, and authentication for all new endpoints.
- Utilized an in-memory dictionary `upload_sessions` within `uploads.py` for managing the state of upload operations.
- Ensured temporary directories (`TEMP_UPLOAD_DIR`) are created and managed.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/models.py` (added new Pydantic models)
- New file: `gitwrite_api/routers/uploads.py` (contains upload logic and routers)
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/main.py` (included new routers)
- New file: `tests/test_api_uploads.py` (unit tests for upload endpoints)
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 5.4 status updated to Completed)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None for this task. The actual integration with `gitwrite_core.versioning.save_changes` and robust cleanup of temporary files post-commit are explicitly deferred to Task 5.5. The current `upload_sessions` is in-memory, which is suitable for this stage but may need a more persistent solution for production.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 5, Task 5.5: Implement the `save` Endpoint Logic.
---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.5: Implement the `save` Endpoint Logic

**Summary:**
Implemented the `POST /repository/save` endpoint and the core function `save_and_commit_file` to allow programmatically saving file content and creating a Git commit.

**Details:**
- Implemented `gitwrite_core/repository.py::save_and_commit_file` to handle the low-level logic of writing a file, staging it, and creating a Git commit with a specified message and author. It creates parent directories as needed and returns the new commit ID.
- Implemented the `POST /repository/save` API endpoint in `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`. This endpoint is authenticated and uses the active user's details for commit authorship. It validates the request using a Pydantic model and calls the core function.
- Created `SaveFileRequest` and `SaveFileResponse` Pydantic models in `gitwrite_api/models.py` to define the schema for the API endpoint.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_core_repository.py` and `tests/test_api_repository.py` to cover both the core logic and the API endpoint's functionality, including success cases and error handling.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `gitwrite_core/repository.py`
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/models.py`
- Modified file: `tests/test_core_repository.py`
- Modified file: `tests/test_api_repository.py`

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. The use of `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH` in the API router is a known item for future dynamic resolution.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
None for this task.
