**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Status Re-evaluation and Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a comprehensive review of the GitWrite project to validate the completion of Phase 6 (API Feature Parity). The analysis revealed several gaps between the project documentation (`writegit-project-doc.md`), the CLI features, and the implemented REST API. The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been significantly updated to reflect the true project status and provide a more detailed roadmap for achieving full feature parity and implementing advanced features.

**Details:**
- **Analysis Findings:**
    - The API is **missing a crucial `init` endpoint** for repository creation, which is available in the CLI.
    - Advanced features specified in `writegit-project-doc.md` are missing from all components (core, CLI, API). These include:
        - Selective Change Integration (cherry-picking).
        - Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB export and annotation handling).
        - Full Publishing Workflow Support (granular RBAC).
- **Corrective Actions:**
    - The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been rewritten.
    - Phase 6 is now correctly marked as "In Progress" and focuses on the remaining API feature gaps, starting with the `init` endpoint.
    - New phases (Phase 7: Advanced Collaboration, Phase 8: SDK Development, Phase 9: Publishing Workflows) have been added and detailed to provide a clear, structured path forward. This addresses the concern about skipping features by breaking them down into verifiable tasks.
- **Project State:** The project is now poised to begin work on the first task of the revised Phase 6.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (content completely replaced with a new, detailed plan).
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.1: Repository Initialization Endpoint, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`.
