**General Instruction:** After completing any task, ensure both `Implementation_Plan.md` and `Memory_Bank.md` are updated to reflect the task's completion and any relevant learnings or changes. The `Implementation_Plan.md` should have the task status updated, and the `Memory_Bank.md` should log the specific outcomes and artifacts produced.

**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Finalize Refactoring Epic and Plan Next Epic

**Summary:**
The CLI refactoring epic is now complete. All core logic has been successfully moved to the `gitwrite_core` library, and the codebase has been reviewed and cleaned. The project is now ready to begin the next major phase: the development of the REST API.

**Details:**
- **Refactoring Complete:** All tasks in Phases 1 through 4 of the `Implementation_Plan.md` are now marked as "Completed".
- **Next Epic - REST API:** A new "Phase 5: REST API Development" has been added to the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- **Technical Decisions for API:**
  - **Framework:** FastAPI
  - **Security:** JWT for authentication.
  - **Deployment:** Containerization via Docker for platform-agnostic deployment.
  - **Structure:** A new `gitwrite_api/` directory will be created at the project root and managed by the central `pyproject.toml`, ensuring proper use of the `gitwrite_core` library.
- **Large File Handling:** Acknowledged the risk of large commits over HTTP. The API will implement a two-step upload process (initiate, upload, complete) to handle large files securely and efficiently, preventing API server bottlenecks. This design is reflected in the new tasks for Phase 5.
- The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been updated with a detailed, actionable plan for building the API.

**Output/Result:**
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- This log entry.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 5, Task 5.1: Initial API and Docker Setup.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.1: Initial API and Docker Setup

**Summary:**
Completed the initial setup for the REST API and Docker containerization. This involved creating the necessary directory structure, updating project dependencies, creating a basic FastAPI application, and configuring a Dockerfile for building and running the API.

**Details:**
- Created `gitwrite_api/` directory at the project root.
- Created `gitwrite_api/__init__.py`.
- Updated `pyproject.toml`:
    - Added `gitwrite_api` to `[tool.poetry.packages]`.
    - Added `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `python-jose[cryptography]` to `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`.
- Ran `poetry lock` and `poetry install` to update dependencies.
- Created `gitwrite_api/main.py` with a basic FastAPI app and a `/` health-check endpoint.
- Created `Dockerfile` at the project root, configured to copy sources, install dependencies via Poetry, and run the API with Uvicorn.
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` to mark Task 5.1 as "Completed".

**Output/Result:**
- New directory: `gitwrite_api/`
- New file: `gitwrite_api/__init__.py`
- New file: `gitwrite_api/main.py`
- New file: `Dockerfile`
- Modified file: `pyproject.toml`
- Modified file: `poetry.lock`
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 5.1 status updated)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 5, Task 5.2: Implement Security and Authentication.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 5, Task 5.3: Agent_API_Dev: Implement Read-Only Repository Endpoints

**Summary:**
Completed the implementation of read-only repository-related API endpoints. This involved adding core Git logic functions, creating a new API router, defining the endpoints, and adding corresponding unit tests.

**Details:**
- **Core Functions Added to `gitwrite_core/repository.py`**:
    - `list_branches(repo_path_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists local branches.
    - `list_tags(repo_path_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists tags.
    - `list_commits(repo_path_str: str, branch_name: Optional[str] = None, max_count: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Lists commits for a branch (or current HEAD), with optional filtering.
- **New API Router**: Created `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py` to handle repository-specific API calls.
- **Implemented Endpoints**:
    - `GET /repository/branches`: Lists all branches.
    - `GET /repository/tags`: Lists all tags.
    - `GET /repository/commits`: Lists commits, accepting optional query parameters `branch_name` (string) and `max_count` (integer).
- **Authentication**: All new endpoints require authentication (currently using a placeholder `get_current_active_user` dependency).
- **Repository Path**: A placeholder `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH` is used in the router, indicating a need for dynamic path determination in future tasks.
- **Unit Tests**: Added `tests/test_api_repository.py` with Pytest tests covering successful responses, unauthorized access (mocked), query parameter handling, and error scenarios by mocking core function return values.
- **Branch**: All development for this task was done on the branch `feature/api-readonly-repo-endpoints`.
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` to mark Task 5.3 as "Completed".

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `gitwrite_core/repository.py` (added new functions)
- New file: `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/main.py` (included new router)
- New file: `tests/test_api_repository.py`
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 5.3 status updated)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None identified. The placeholder for repository path and authentication are known items for future refinement as per the overall plan.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the next planned task in Phase 5.
