**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Project Planning & Strategy Update

**Summary:**
Completed a major overhaul of the `Implementation_Plan.md` to accurately reflect the project's current state and future goals. The new plan prioritizes achieving feature parity between the REST API and the existing CLI/core functionalities.

**Details:**
- The previous implementation plan was found to be outdated, as it did not account for exposing the full range of features already developed in `gitwrite_core` and the `gitwrite_cli`.
- The entire content of `Implementation_Plan.md` has been replaced with a new, comprehensive plan.
- The new plan introduces "Phase 6: API Feature Parity with CLI" to systematically add endpoints for branching, merging, reverting, syncing, tagging, and ignore management.
- A new "Phase 7: TypeScript SDK Development" has been added and explicitly marked as "On Hold" to clarify that API completion is the immediate priority.
- This strategic update ensures all subsequent work is aligned with the goal of creating a feature-complete API layer before moving on to client-side development.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (content completely replaced)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.1: Branching Endpoints as per the new Implementation Plan.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 6, Task 6.1: Branching Endpoints

**Summary:**
Implemented two new API endpoints for repository branch management: `POST /repository/branches` for creating and switching to a new branch, and `PUT /repository/branch` for switching to an existing branch. Added comprehensive unit tests for both endpoints.

**Details:**
- **`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py` modifications:**
    - Added Pydantic models: `BranchCreateRequest`, `BranchSwitchRequest`, `BranchResponse`.
    - Implemented `POST /repository/branches`:
        - Takes `branch_name` in request body.
        - Calls `gitwrite_core.branching.create_and_switch_branch`.
        - Handles success (201 Created) and errors (409 Conflict for existing branch, 400 Bad Request for empty repo/unborn HEAD, 500 for other core errors).
        - Protected by authentication dependency.
    - Implemented `PUT /repository/branch`:
        - Takes `branch_name` in request body.
        - Calls `gitwrite_core.branching.switch_to_branch`.
        - Handles success (200 OK for switch, 200 OK for already on branch) and errors (404 Not Found for non-existent branch, 400/409 for core errors like uncommitted changes, 500 for other core errors).
        - Protected by authentication dependency.
- **`tests/test_api_repository.py` modifications:**
    - Added unit tests for `POST /repository/branches`:
        - Test successful creation (201).
        - Test `BranchAlreadyExistsError` (409).
        - Test `RepositoryEmptyError` (400).
        - Test generic `GitWriteError` (500).
        - Test `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500).
        - Test unauthorized access (401).
        - Test invalid payload (422).
    - Added unit tests for `PUT /repository/branch`:
        - Test successful switch (200).
        - Test "already on branch" (200).
        - Test `BranchNotFoundError` (404).
        - Test `RepositoryEmptyError` (400).
        - Test `GitWriteError` (uncommitted changes -> 409, other -> 400).
        - Test `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500).
        - Test unauthorized access (401).
        - Test invalid payload (422).
    - All new tests use mocking for core functions and authentication.
- **`Implementation_Plan.md` updated:**
    - Marked Task 6.1 as "Completed".

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
- Modified file: `tests/test_api_repository.py`
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md`
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.3: Revert and Sync Endpoints as per the Implementation Plan.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 6, Task 6.2: Merge and Compare Endpoints

**Summary:**
Implemented API endpoints for merging branches (`POST /repository/merges`) and comparing references (`GET /repository/compare`). This included adding Pydantic models for request and response bodies, implementing the endpoint logic with comprehensive error handling, and writing extensive unit tests.

**Details:**
- **`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py` modifications:**
    - Added Pydantic models:
        - `MergeBranchRequest` (for `source_branch`)
        - `MergeBranchResponse` (for status, message, current/merged branches, commit OID, conflicting files)
        - `CompareRefsResponse` (for ref OIDs, display names, patch text)
    - Implemented `POST /repository/merges`:
        - Takes `source_branch` in request body.
        - Calls `gitwrite_core.branching.merge_branch_into_current`.
        - Handles success states (200 OK for `merged_ok`, `fast_forwarded`, `up_to_date`).
        - Handles `CoreMergeConflictError` (409 Conflict, with structured detail including conflicting files).
        - Handles `CoreBranchNotFoundError` (404 Not Found).
        - Handles `CoreRepositoryEmptyError`, `CoreDetachedHeadError`, other `CoreGitWriteError` (400 Bad Request).
        - Handles `CoreRepositoryNotFoundError` (500 Internal Server Error).
        - Protected by authentication.
    - Implemented `GET /repository/compare`:
        - Takes `ref1` and `ref2` as optional query parameters.
        - Calls `gitwrite_core.versioning.get_diff`.
        - Handles success (200 OK with diff details).
        - Handles `CoreCommitNotFoundError` (404 Not Found).
        - Handles `CoreNotEnoughHistoryError`, `ValueError` (from core for invalid refs) (400 Bad Request).
        - Handles `CoreRepositoryNotFoundError` (500 Internal Server Error).
        - Handles other `CoreGitWriteError` (500 Internal Server Error).
        - Protected by authentication.
- **`tests/test_api_repository.py` modifications:**
    - Added unit tests for `POST /repository/merges`:
        - Tested successful merge outcomes: `fast_forwarded`, `merged_ok`, `up_to_date`.
        - Tested `CoreMergeConflictError` (409 response with structured conflict details).
        - Tested `CoreBranchNotFoundError` (404).
        - Tested `CoreRepositoryEmptyError`, `CoreDetachedHeadError`, specific `CoreGitWriteError`s (e.g., merge into self, no signature) (400).
        - Tested `CoreRepositoryNotFoundError` (500).
        - Tested unauthorized access (401) and invalid payload (422).
    - Added unit tests for `GET /repository/compare`:
