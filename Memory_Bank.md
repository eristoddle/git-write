**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Status Re-evaluation and Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a comprehensive review of the GitWrite project to validate the completion of Phase 6 (API Feature Parity). The analysis revealed several gaps between the project documentation (`writegit-project-doc.md`), the CLI features, and the implemented REST API. The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been significantly updated to reflect the true project status and provide a more detailed roadmap for achieving full feature parity and implementing advanced features.

**Details:**
- **Analysis Findings:**
    - The API is **missing a crucial `init` endpoint** for repository creation, which is available in the CLI.
    - Advanced features specified in `writegit-project-doc.md` are missing from all components (core, CLI, API). These include:
        - Selective Change Integration (cherry-picking).
        - Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB export and annotation handling).
        - Full Publishing Workflow Support (granular RBAC).
- **Corrective Actions:**
    - The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been rewritten.
    - Phase 6 is now correctly marked as "In Progress" and focuses on the remaining API feature gaps, starting with the `init` endpoint.
    - New phases (Phase 7: Advanced Collaboration, Phase 8: SDK Development, Phase 9: Publishing Workflows) have been added and detailed to provide a clear, structured path forward. This addresses the concern about skipping features by breaking them down into verifiable tasks.
- **Project State:** The project is now poised to begin work on the first task of the revised Phase 6.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (content completely replaced with a new, detailed plan).
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.1: Repository Initialization Endpoint, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 6, Task 6.1: Repository Initialization Endpoint

**Summary:**
Implemented the `POST /repositories` API endpoint to allow clients to initialize new GitWrite repositories. This functionality mirrors the `gitwrite init` CLI command. The endpoint supports creating a repository with a specific project name or generating a unique ID if no name is provided. It integrates with the existing `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository` function and includes comprehensive error handling and unit tests.

**Details:**
-   **API Endpoint Implementation (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Created `POST /repositories` endpoint.
    -   Request body uses `RepositoryCreateRequest` model (from `gitwrite_api/models.py`) with an optional `project_name: str`.
        -   If `project_name` is provided, it's used as the directory name under `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH/gitwrite_user_repos/`.
        -   If `project_name` is not provided, a UUID is generated and used as the directory name under `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH/gitwrite_user_repos/`.
    -   Response model is `RepositoryCreateResponse`, returning `status`, `message`, `repository_id`, and `path`.
    -   Endpoint is protected by `get_current_active_user` dependency.
    -   Handles responses from `core_initialize_repository`:
        -   `201 Created`: On successful initialization.
        -   `409 Conflict`: If the repository directory already exists and is not a valid target (e.g., non-empty, non-Git directory, or a conflicting file name).
        -   `500 Internal Server Error`: For other core errors or issues like inability to create base directories.
-   **Pydantic Models:**
    -   `gitwrite_api/models.py`: Added `RepositoryCreateRequest(BaseModel)`.
        ```python
        class RepositoryCreateRequest(BaseModel):
            project_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=1, pattern=r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$", description="Optional name for the repository. If provided, it will be used as the directory name. Must be alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores.")
        ```
    -   `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`: Added `RepositoryCreateResponse(BaseModel)`.
        ```python
        class RepositoryCreateResponse(BaseModel):
            status: str = Field(..., description="Outcome of the repository creation operation (e.g., 'created').")
            message: str = Field(..., description="Detailed message about the creation outcome.")
            repository_id: str = Field(..., description="The ID or name of the created repository.")
            path: str = Field(..., description="The server path to the created repository.")
        ```
-   **Key Endpoint Snippet (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    ```python
    @router.post("/repositories", response_model=RepositoryCreateResponse, status_code=201)
    async def api_initialize_repository(
        request_data: RepositoryCreateRequest,
        current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
    ):
        repo_base_path = Path(PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH) / "gitwrite_user_repos"
        project_name_to_use: str
        if request_data.project_name:
            project_name_to_use = request_data.project_name
            core_project_name_arg = request_data.project_name
            core_path_str_arg = str(repo_base_path)
        else:
            project_name_to_use = str(uuid.uuid4())
            core_project_name_arg = None
            core_path_str_arg = str(repo_base_path / project_name_to_use)

        repo_base_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) # Simplified try-catch not shown

        result = core_initialize_repository(
            path_str=core_path_str_arg,
            project_name=core_project_name_arg
        )
        # ... (response handling logic) ...
    ```
-   **Unit Test Implementation (`tests/test_api_repository.py`):**
    -   Added new test functions for `POST /repository/repositories`.
    -   Mocked `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository` and `uuid.uuid4`.
    -   Tested scenarios:
        -   Successful creation with project name (201).
        -   Successful creation without project name (UUID used, 201).
        -   Attempting to create where a directory/file conflict occurs (409).
        -   Core function generic error (500).
        -   Base directory creation OS error (500).
        -   Unauthorized request (401).
        -   Invalid payload (e.g., invalid project name characters, empty project name) (422).
-   **Key Unit Test Snippet (`tests/test_api_repository.py` for success with project name):**
    ```python
    @patch('gitwrite_api.routers.repository.core_initialize_repository')
    @patch('gitwrite_api.routers.repository.uuid.uuid4')
    def test_api_initialize_repository_with_project_name_success(mock_uuid4, mock_core_init_repo):
        app.dependency_overrides[actual_repo_auth_dependency] = mock_get_current_active_user
        project_name = "test-project"
        expected_repo_path = f"{MOCK_REPO_PATH}/gitwrite_user_repos/{project_name}"

        mock_core_init_repo.return_value = {
            "status": "success",
            "message": f"Repository '{project_name}' initialized.",
            "path": expected_repo_path
        }
        payload = RepositoryCreateRequest(project_name=project_name)
        response = client.post("/repository/repositories", json=payload.model_dump())

        assert response.status_code == HTTPStatus.CREATED
        data = response.json()
        assert data["status"] == "created"
        assert data["repository_id"] == project_name
        # ... more assertions ...
        app.dependency_overrides = {}
    ```
-   **Testing Confirmation:** All new unit tests passed successfully.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/models.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
-   Modified `tests/test_api_repository.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.2 - Agent_CLI_Dev: Cherry-Pick CLI Commands

**Summary:**
Implemented two new CLI commands: `gitwrite review <branch>` and `gitwrite cherry-pick <commit_id>`.
The `review` command lists commits on a specified branch that are not present in the current HEAD, aiding in understanding changes before potential integration.
The `cherry-pick` command allows applying a specific commit from any part of the history to the current branch.
Core logic for reviewing branches was added, and comprehensive unit tests for both CLI commands were implemented.

**Details:**
-   **Core Logic for Review (`gitwrite_core/versioning.py`):**
    -   Added new function `get_branch_review_commits(repo_path_str: str, branch_name_to_review: str, limit: Optional[int] = None) -> List[Dict]`.
    -   This function identifies commits on the `branch_name_to_review` that are not ancestors of the current `HEAD`.
    -   It returns a list of commit data (hash, author, date, message) suitable for display.
    -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError`, `BranchNotFoundError`.
    -   Added `BranchNotFoundError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
-   **CLI Command `gitwrite review <branch_name>` (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    -   Takes a `branch_name` argument and an optional `-n/--number` limit.
    -   Calls `core.get_branch_review_commits`.
    -   Displays results in a `rich.table.Table`.
    -   Handles exceptions and provides user-friendly error messages.
-   **CLI Command `gitwrite cherry-pick <commit_id>` (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    -   Takes a `commit_id` argument and an optional `--mainline <num>` integer option.
    -   Calls `core.cherry_pick_commit`.
    -   Displays success message with new commit OID or error messages.
    -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError`, `CommitNotFoundError`, `MergeConflictError` (listing conflicting files), and other `GitWriteError` exceptions.
-   **Unit Tests (`tests/test_cli_review_cherry_pick.py`):**
    -   Created a new test file for these commands.
    -   **`review` command tests:**
        -   Successful listing of unique commits.
        -   Branch not found.
        -   No unique commits.
        -   Non-Git repository.
        -   Usage of `--number` limit.
    -   **`cherry-pick` command tests:**
        -   Successful cherry-pick.
        -   Cherry-pick with conflicts.
        -   Commit not found.
        -   Cherry-picking a merge commit (with and without mainline, valid/invalid mainline).
        -   Non-Git repository.
        -   Generic `GitWriteError` from core.
    -   Tests mock core functions and assert CLI output and exit codes.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_cli/main.py`
-   Created `tests/test_cli_review_cherry_pick.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.2 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 7.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Cherry-Pick API Endpoints.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Cherry-Pick API Endpoints

**Summary:**
Implemented API endpoints to support reviewing commits on a branch and cherry-picking specific commits.
A `GET /repository/review/{branch_name}` endpoint was created to list commits on a specified branch not present in the current HEAD, facilitating review before integration.
A `POST /repository/cherry-pick` endpoint was created to apply a specific commit to the current branch, supporting an optional `mainline` parameter for merge commits.
These endpoints leverage the corresponding core functions. Pydantic models for requests and responses were defined, and comprehensive unit tests were added.

**Details:**
-   **Pydantic Models (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    -   Added `CherryPickRequest(BaseModel)`: with `commit_id: str` and `mainline: Optional[int]`.
    -   Added `CherryPickResponse(BaseModel)`: with `status: str`, `message: str`, `new_commit_oid: Optional[str]`, and `conflicting_files: Optional[List[str]]`.
    -   Added `BranchReviewCommit(BaseModel)`: with `short_hash: str`, `author_name: str`, `date: str`, `message_short: str`, `oid: str`.
    -   Added `BranchReviewResponse(BaseModel)`: with `status: str`, `branch_name: str`, `commits: List[BranchReviewCommit]`, `message: str`.
-   **API Endpoint `GET /repository/review/{branch_name}` (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Accepts `branch_name` path parameter and optional `limit` query parameter.
    -   Calls `core_get_branch_review_commits` from `gitwrite_core.versioning`.
    -   Returns `BranchReviewResponse` (200 OK).
    -   Handles `BranchNotFoundError` (404), `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500), `GitWriteError` (e.g., unborn HEAD - 400, other 500).
-   **API Endpoint `POST /repository/cherry-pick` (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Accepts `CherryPickRequest` in the body.
    -   Calls `core_cherry_pick_commit` from `gitwrite_core.versioning`.
    -   Returns `CherryPickResponse` (200 OK).
        -   Handles successful cherry-pick.
        -   Handles conflicts by returning `status="conflict"` and `conflicting_files`.
        -   Handles `CommitNotFoundError` (404).
        -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500).
        -   Handles `GitWriteError` for issues like unborn HEAD, missing/invalid mainline for merge commits (400).
-   **Unit Tests (`tests/test_api_cherry_pick.py`):**
    -   Created a new test file for these API endpoints.
    -   **Review endpoint tests:** Success, with limit, no unique commits, branch not found, repo not found, unborn HEAD, unauthorized.
    -   **Cherry-pick endpoint tests:** Success, success with mainline, conflict, commit not found, merge commit without mainline, invalid mainline, unborn HEAD, repo not found, generic GitWriteError, unauthorized, invalid payloads.
    -   Mocked core functions and asserted responses and status codes.
    -   Installed `pytest`, `pygit2`, `click`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `rich`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-multipart` to run tests.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/models.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
-   Created `tests/test_api_cherry_pick.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.3 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 7.4 - Agent_Core_Dev: Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB Export).

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.4 - Agent_Core_Dev: Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB Export)

**Summary:**
Implemented the core functionality within `gitwrite_core` to export specified Markdown files from a Git repository at a given commit-ish to an EPUB file. This involved adding `pypandoc` as a dependency, creating an `export.py` module, and implementing the `export_to_epub` function with comprehensive error handling and unit tests.

**Details:**
-   **Dependency Management:**
    -   Added `pypandoc = "^1.13"` to `pyproject.toml`.
    -   Ensured `pandoc` (the underlying CLI tool) is installed in the environment (using `sudo apt-get install pandoc`).
-   **Core Module (`gitwrite_core/export.py`):**
    -   Created a new module `gitwrite_core/export.py`.
    -   Implemented the function `export_to_epub(repo_path_str: str, commit_ish_str: str, file_list: List[str], output_epub_path_str: str) -> Dict[str, str]`.
-   **Functionality of `export_to_epub`:**
    -   Uses `pygit2` to access the Git repository and retrieve specific file contents from the tree of the resolved `commit_ish_str` (commit hash, branch name, or tag).
    -   Concatenates the UTF-8 decoded content of the specified Markdown files, separated by a standard Markdown horizontal rule.
    -   Utilizes `pypandoc.convert_text()` to convert the combined Markdown string into an EPUB file, saved to `output_epub_path_str`.
    -   The function returns a dictionary `{"status": "success", "message": "..."}` on successful generation.
-   **Error Handling and Custom Exceptions:**
    -   The function raises specific custom exceptions derived from `GitWriteError` for various failure scenarios:
        -   `PandocError`: If `pypandoc.get_pandoc_path()` fails (Pandoc not found) or if `pypandoc.convert_text()` encounters a runtime error.
        -   `RepositoryNotFoundError`: If the provided repository path is not a directory, not a valid Git repository, or an invalid path.
        -   `CommitNotFoundError`: If the `commit_ish_str` cannot be resolved to a valid commit object (handles invalid refs, tags not pointing to commits, or refs pointing to non-commit objects like blobs/trees).
        -   `FileNotFoundInCommitError`: If a file specified in `file_list` is not found in the resolved commit's tree or if the entry is not a blob (e.g., it's a directory).
        -   `GitWriteError`: For other issues like an empty repository, an empty `file_list`, non-UTF-8 file content, or if all specified files are empty/contain only whitespace, or if output directory creation fails.
    -   Added new exceptions to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`: `PandocError`, `FileNotFoundInCommitError`.
-   **Unit Testing (`tests/test_core_export.py`):**
    -   Created a new test file `tests/test_core_export.py`.
    -   Implemented 19 passing unit tests and 1 skipped test (for annotated tags pointing to non-commits, which is hard to set up reliably with pygit2).
    -   Tests cover:
        -   Successful EPUB generation with various `commit_ish` types (HEAD, branch, tag).
        -   All defined error handling paths (Pandoc not found, repo/commit/file errors, empty content, non-UTF-8, output issues, Pandoc conversion errors).
        -   Mocking of `pypandoc` functions and `pathlib.Path.mkdir` for isolated testing.
        -   A helper function `init_test_repo_corrected` was created to simplify test repository setup.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `pyproject.toml` (added `pypandoc`).
-   Created `gitwrite_core/export.py` (contains `export_to_epub` function).
-   Modified `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` (added `PandocError`, `FileNotFoundInCommitError`).
-   Created `tests/test_core_export.py` (contains unit tests for export functionality).
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.4 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. Iterative debugging of `IndentationError`s caused by diff tool issues was time-consuming but ultimately resolved.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 7.5 - Agent_CLI_Dev & Agent_API_Dev: Export Endpoints.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.5 - Agent_CLI_Dev & Agent_API_Dev: Export Endpoints

**Summary:**
Implemented CLI and API endpoints to expose the EPUB export functionality previously added to `gitwrite_core`.
The CLI command `gitwrite export epub` allows users to specify an output path, commit-ish, and a list of Markdown files to compile into an EPUB.
The API endpoint `POST /repository/export/epub` accepts similar parameters and saves the generated EPUB to a unique path on the server, returning this path in the response.
Both interfaces leverage `gitwrite_core.export.export_to_epub` and include comprehensive error handling. Pydantic models for the API request and response were defined, and unit tests for both CLI and API were created.

**Details:**
-   **Pydantic Models for API (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    -   Created `EPUBExportRequest(BaseModel)`:
        -   `commit_ish: str` (default: "HEAD")
        -   `file_list: List[str]` (min_items: 1)
        -   `output_filename: str` (pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+\.epub$`)
    -   Created `EPUBExportResponse(BaseModel)`:
        -   `status: str`
        -   `message: str`
        -   `server_file_path: Optional[str]`
-   **API Endpoint (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Added `POST /repository/export/epub`.
    -   Accepts `EPUBExportRequest`.
    -   Generates a unique export directory (`PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH/exports/<uuid>/`) for each EPUB.
    -   Calls `core.export_to_epub`, passing the constructed server path for the output EPUB.
    -   Returns `EPUBExportResponse` with `server_file_path` on success.
    -   Handles `CoreRepositoryNotFoundError` (500), `CoreCommitNotFoundError` (404), `CoreFileNotFoundInCommitError` (404), `CorePandocError` (503 if Pandoc not found, 400 if conversion error), `CoreGitWriteError` (400), and `OSError` for directory creation issues (500).
-   **CLI Command (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    -   Created new command group `gitwrite export`.
    -   Added subcommand `epub` to `export`: `gitwrite export epub`.
    -   Options:
        -   `-o, --output-path <path>` (Required): Destination for the EPUB file.
        -   `-c, --commit <commit_ish>` (Optional, default: "HEAD").
    -   Arguments: `FILES ...` (Required, list of Markdown files).
    -   Calls `core.export_to_epub` with `Path.cwd()` as repo path.
    -   Prints success/error messages; handles core exceptions similarly to the API, exiting with status 1 on error.
    -   Ensures output directory's parent exists before calling core function.
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   Created `tests/test_api_export.py`:
        -   Tested `POST /repository/export/epub` for success, various core error propagations (400, 404, 500, 503), OS errors for directory creation, invalid payloads (422), and unauthorized access (401).
        -   Mocked `gitwrite_core.export.export_to_epub`, `pathlib.Path`, and `uuid.uuid4`.
    -   Created `tests/test_cli_export.py`:
        -   Tested `gitwrite export epub` using `CliRunner`.
        -   Covered success cases, default commit usage, missing file arguments, missing output path, and various core error propagations.
        -   Mocked `gitwrite_core.export.export_to_epub`, `Path.cwd()`, and `pathlib.Path.mkdir`.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/models.py` (added `EPUBExportRequest`, `EPUBExportResponse`).
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py` (added `POST /repository/export/epub` endpoint).
-   Modified `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (added `gitwrite export epub` command and necessary imports).
-   Created `tests/test_api_export.py`.
-   Created `tests/test_cli_export.py`.
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.5 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the next phase (Phase 8: TypeScript SDK Development) as per `Implementation_Plan.md`.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 8, Task 8.1 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Update SDK for API Parity

**Summary:**
Updated the TypeScript SDK (`gitwrite_sdk`) to include client methods and types for all currently implemented API endpoints in `gitwrite_api`. This brings the SDK to parity with the existing REST API, covering functionalities for repository management, version control operations, collaboration features, and content export.

**Details:**
-   **Type Definitions (`gitwrite_sdk/src/types.ts`):**
    -   Added TypeScript interfaces for request payloads and response data for 13 API endpoints previously not covered by the SDK. These include:
        -   Repository initialization (`RepositoryCreateRequest`, `RepositoryCreateResponse`)
        -   Branch creation and switching (`BranchCreateRequest`, `BranchSwitchRequest`, `BranchResponse`)
        -   Merging (`MergeBranchRequest`, `MergeBranchResponse`)
        -   Comparison (`CompareRefsParams`, `CompareRefsResponse`)
        -   Reverting commits (`RevertCommitRequest`, `RevertCommitResponse`)
        -   Repository synchronization (`SyncRepositoryRequest`, `SyncRepositoryResponse`, `SyncFetchStatus`, `SyncLocalUpdateStatus`, `SyncPushStatus`)
        -   Tag creation (`TagCreateRequest`, `TagCreateResponse`)
        -   .gitignore management (`IgnoreListResponse`, `IgnorePatternRequest`, `IgnoreAddResponse`)
        -   Branch review (`BranchReviewCommit`, `ReviewBranchParams`, `BranchReviewResponse`)
        -   Cherry-picking (`CherryPickRequest`, `CherryPickResponse`)
        -   EPUB export (`EPUBExportRequest`, `EPUBExportResponse`)
    -   Ensured these types accurately reflect the Pydantic models used in the FastAPI backend.

-   **Client Method Implementations (`gitwrite_sdk/src/apiClient.ts`):**
    -   Added 13 new public methods to the `GitWriteClient` class, corresponding to the newly typed API endpoints:
        -   `initializeRepository(payload?: RepositoryCreateRequest): Promise<RepositoryCreateResponse>`
        -   `createBranch(payload: BranchCreateRequest): Promise<BranchResponse>`
        -   `switchBranch(payload: BranchSwitchRequest): Promise<BranchResponse>`

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 8, Task 8.2 - Agent_SDK_Dev: Comprehensive SDK Testing

**Summary:**
Implemented comprehensive unit tests for all new methods added to the TypeScript SDK (`gitwrite_sdk`) in Task 8.1. This ensures robust testing coverage for SDK functionalities corresponding to repository initialization, branch management, merging, comparison, reverting, syncing, tagging, .gitignore handling, branch review, cherry-picking, and EPUB export.

**Details:**
-   **Test File:** `gitwrite_sdk/tests/apiClient.test.ts`
-   **Methodology:**
    -   For each of the 13 new SDK methods, `describe` blocks were added.
    -   `beforeEach` was used to set up the `GitWriteClient` and mock authentication.
    -   **Success Case Tests:**
        -   Mocked API responses using `mockRequest` (the mocked generic Axios request method).
        -   Asserted that `mockRequest` was called with correct URLs, methods, payloads/params.
        -   Asserted that SDK methods returned the expected data based on mock responses.
        -   Covered cases with and without optional parameters for methods like `compareRefs` and `reviewBranch`.
    -   **Error Case Tests:**
        -   Mocked `mockRequest` to reject with Axios-like error objects.
        -   Asserted that SDK methods correctly throw or propagate these errors.
-   **Specific Client Methods Tested:**
    -   `initializeRepository`
    -   `createBranch`
    -   `switchBranch`
    -   `mergeBranch`
    -   `compareRefs`
    -   `revertCommit`
    -   `syncRepository`
    -   `createTag`
    -   `listIgnorePatterns`
    -   `addIgnorePattern`
    -   `reviewBranch`
    -   `cherryPickCommit`
    -   `exportToEPUB`
-   **Test Execution and Debugging:**
    -   Initially encountered a `ts-jest` preset not found error, resolved by running `npm install` within the `gitwrite_sdk` directory using a subshell `(cd gitwrite_sdk && npm install)`.
    -   A typo (`response.data` instead of `completeResponse.data`) in `gitwrite_sdk/src/apiClient.ts` (line 288, within `saveFiles` method) was identified during test runs and corrected.
    -   Two test assertions for methods called without optional parameters (`compareRefs` and `reviewBranch`) were updated to expect `params: undefined` instead of `params: {}` for the mocked Axios call, aligning with actual behavior.
    -   All 58 tests in the suite now pass.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_sdk/tests/apiClient.test.ts` (added comprehensive tests for 13 methods).
-   Modified `gitwrite_sdk/src/apiClient.ts` (corrected a typo in the `saveFiles` method).
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 8.2 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Minor issues with bash session state for `cd` commands were worked around using subshells. Initial test failures led to identifying and fixing a pre-existing typo in the SDK source and refining test assertions.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 9: Publishing & Documentation Workflows, starting with Task 9.1.
