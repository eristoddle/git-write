**Agent:** Manager Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Project State Summary - CLI MVP

**Summary:**
The GitWrite CLI MVP development has progressed through the implementation of core features including `init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, and `revert`. Testing for `revert` and `init` is complete. A bug in `init` was found and fixed. A reported `sync` typo was investigated and found to be likely already resolved.

**Details:**
- **Implemented Commands:**
    - `gitwrite init [project_name]`: Initializes project structure.
    - `gitwrite save "message" [-i <path1> [-i <path2> ...]]`: Stages changes and commits.
        - Default behavior (no `-i`/`--include`): Stages all changes (new, modified, deleted files) in the working directory and creates a commit.
        - Handles finalization of merge commits (after conflict resolution by user).
        - Handles finalization of revert commits (after conflict resolution by user).
        - **Selective Staging with `--include` / `-i`:**
            - **Usage:** `gitwrite save -i <path1> -i <path2> ... "message"`
            - **Behavior:**
                - If `--include` is used, only the specified paths (files or directories) will be staged for the commit.
                - If a directory is specified, all changes within that directory are staged.
                - If no `--include` is specified, all changes in the working directory are staged (default behavior).
            - **Error Handling / Warnings (for `--include`):**
                - If a specified path is not found in the repository, has no changes, or is ignored by `.gitignore`, a warning is printed. The command will proceed with any other valid files specified.
                - If none of the specified paths have any changes or if all specified paths are invalid (e.g., non-existent, ignored, no changes), the command will output messages indicating this and state "No changes to save." No commit will be made.
            - **Interaction with Merge/Revert (for `--include`):**
                - Using `--include` is **disallowed** when the repository is in an active merge state (`MERGE_HEAD` exists) or an active revert state (`REVERT_HEAD` exists). An error message will be displayed, and no action will be taken.
                - To complete a merge or revert operation, `gitwrite save "message"` (i.e., without `--include`) must be used. This will stage all resolved changes and finalize the operation.
    - `gitwrite history [-n count]`: Displays formatted commit history.
    - `gitwrite explore <branch_name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
    - `gitwrite switch [<branch_name>]`: Switches to an existing branch or lists branches.
    - `gitwrite merge <branch_name>`: Merges branches, handling fast-forwards, normal merges, and conflicts (manual resolution + `gitwrite save`).
    - `gitwrite compare [ref1] [ref2]`: Displays word-level diff.
    - `gitwrite sync [--remote <remote>] [--branch <branch>]`: Fetches, pulls/merges, and pushes changes.
    - `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]`: Reverts specified commit (non-merge commits fully supported; merge commits have limitations).
- **Code Committed:**
    - Features up to `sync` were on `cli-mvp-features`.
    - The `revert` command and its tests were developed on the `feature/revert-command` branch.
    - `init` command tests and a related bugfix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` are part of the current work.

**Output/Result:**
- **Committed Code:** Branch `feature/revert-command` contains the `revert` feature. Other features are on `cli-mvp-features` or merged to main. Recent `init` tests and fixes are pending commit/merge.
- **Known Typo:** In `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (sync command) - **INVESTIGATED**: Typo `paciente=True` not found; likely already fixed or misreported.
- **Identified Limitation:** `gitwrite revert` cannot perform index-only reverts of merge commits with specific mainline parent selection due to underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` behavior in v1.18.0; CLI now errors gracefully for this case.
- **Bug Fix (init):** Corrected `repo.status_file()` call in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to use relative path for `.gitignore`, fixing an idempotency issue.

**Status:** Testing and Refinement in Progress

**Issues/Blockers (Current):**
- No major environment blockers.

**Completed Original Plan Items (Previously Blocked):**
- Step 8: Implement `gitwrite revert` - **DONE** (with noted limitations for merge commits)
- Step 9: Develop Unit and Integration Tests (for `revert`) - **DONE**

**Remaining Original Plan Items (Adjusted):**
- Comprehensive testing for *all* CLI commands. (`init` and `revert` commands now have good test coverage).
- Address `sync` command typo. - **DONE** (Investigated, typo not found, likely already fixed or misreported).
- Step 10: Create User Documentation.
- Step 11: Refine CLI and Address Issues (e.g., review `revert` merge limitations for future improvement if library changes; bug in `init` regarding `status_file` path was fixed).
- Step 12: Update `Memory_Bank.md` file - This log entry. (Ongoing)
- Step 13: Add Memory Bank and Handover Protocol notes to `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Step 14: Finalize the initial CLI application.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- **Your Action:**
    - Review and merge `feature/revert-command` (if not already done).
    - Prioritize next development tasks:
        - Continue comprehensive testing for other CLI commands (`save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, `tag`, `ignore`).
        - Begin work on User Documentation (Step 10).
- **My Action:** Awaiting your guidance.

**Update: `init` Command Testing, `sync` Typo Investigation, and `init` Bug Fix**

This update covers the investigation of a reported typo in the `sync` command, the successful implementation of comprehensive tests for the `gitwrite init` command, and a bug fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` that was discovered during this testing phase.

**1. `sync` Command Typo (`paciente=True`) Investigation:**
-   A thorough review of the `gitwrite_cli/main.py` file, specifically the `sync` command, was conducted. This included manual code inspection and `grep` searches for the term "paciente".
-   **Conclusion:** The reported typo `paciente=True` was **not found** in the codebase.
    -   All `click.echo` statements within the `sync` command correctly use `err=True` for error messages intended for `stderr`, or no `err` parameter (which defaults to `err=False`, i.e., `stdout`) for standard informational messages.
    -   It is presumed that the typo was either fixed in a previous, unlogged commit or the initial report was inaccurate regarding the parameter name or its existence.
    -   This item is now considered closed.

**2. `gitwrite init` Command Testing:**
-   A new test class, `TestGitWriteInit`, was added to `tests/test_main.py` to provide comprehensive test coverage for the `gitwrite init` command.
-   **Key Scenarios Tested and Passing (8 tests in total):**
    -   Successful initialization in an empty current directory (when no project name is provided).
    -   Successful initialization when a `project_name` is specified (creating the project directory).
    -   Correct creation of the standard GitWrite project structure: `drafts/`, `notes/` directories, `metadata.yml` file, and `.gitkeep` files within `drafts/` and `notes/`.
    -   Generation of a `.gitignore` file with common Python and IDE ignore patterns.
    -   Verification of the initial commit: correct commit message, author details (GitWrite System), and presence of core structure files in the commit tree.
    -   Error handling for invalid target names:
        -   When the specified `project_name` already exists as a file.
        -   When the `project_name` directory exists, is not empty, and is not a Git repository.
    -   Correct behavior when `init` is run in an existing Git repository (i.e., adds GitWrite structure and files, creates a new commit, but does not re-initialize the `.git` directory).
    -   Error handling when `init` is run in a non-empty current directory that is not a Git repository (and no project name is given).
    -   Verification that `init` correctly appends GitWrite-specific patterns to a pre-existing `.gitignore` file, preserving user's custom entries.
    -   Idempotency: ensuring that running `init` multiple times in an already correctly initialized GitWrite directory does not create redundant new commits.
-   All tests for `TestGitWriteInit` are currently passing.

**3. Bug Fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (related to `init` command):**
-   **Discovery:** During the development of the idempotency test for `gitwrite init` (`test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure`), a bug was uncovered. When `init` was run a second time in an already initialized directory, an unexpected `KeyError` related to `.gitignore` would occur.
-   **Root Cause:** The `init` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was calling `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))`. The function `repo.status_file()` expects a path relative to the repository's working directory, but `str(gitignore_file)` was providing an absolute path. This caused `pygit2` to raise a `KeyError` when it couldn't find the absolute path in its internal representation of the working tree.
-   **Fix:** The call was changed from `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))` to `repo.status_file(gitignore_file.name)`. Since `gitignore_file` is defined as `target_dir / ".gitignore"`, `gitignore_file.name` correctly provides the relative filename `".gitignore"`.
-   This fix allowed the `test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure` to pass and ensures more robust behavior for the `init` command.

**Update: `gitwrite revert` Implementation and Testing**

The `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]` command has been successfully implemented and tested.

**Key Features & Details:**
-   **Non-Merge Commits:** Successfully reverts non-merge commits. A new commit is created with a standard message format (e.g., "Revert '[original commit message]'"), and the working directory reflects the undone changes.
-   **Conflict Handling:** If a revert attempt results in conflicts, the command updates the index with conflict markers and creates `REVERT_HEAD`. It then instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts and use `gitwrite save "message"` to complete the revert.
-   **`gitwrite save` Enhancement:** The `save` command was updated to detect the presence of `REVERT_HEAD`. If found, it automatically prepends the standard "Revert '[original commit message]'" to the user's provided save message, ensuring clear commit history for resolved reverts. It also correctly cleans up `REVERT_HEAD` (and `MERGE_HEAD` if applicable) via `repo.state_cleanup()`.
-   **Merge Commit Reverts (Limitation Identified):**
    *   During development, it was discovered that `pygit2.Repository.revert()` (version 1.18.0, as installed in the environment) does not reliably support specifying a mainline parent for merge commits when the goal is to *only update the index* (as opposed to directly creating the revert commit). Attempts to pass `mainline` as a keyword or positional argument led to various `TypeError` or specific errors from `libgit2` (e.g., "mainline branch is not specified..."). `RevertOptions` was also found to be not directly importable from `pygit2` in this version.
    *   Consequently, the `gitwrite revert` command now detects if the target commit is a merge commit. If so, it informs the user that this specific operation (index-only revert of a merge commit, especially with mainline selection) is not supported with the current underlying library method and fails gracefully with an error message. The `--mainline` option is therefore only relevant for informational purposes if a future `pygit2` version or method allows it.
-   **Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `revert` command were added to `tests/test_main.py`.
    *   Scenarios covered include: successful non-merge reverts, reverting an initial commit, reverting a revert commit, attempts to revert with a dirty working directory, invalid commit references, and handling of conflicts (including resolution via `gitwrite save`).
    *   The merge commit revert test was updated to assert that the CLI now correctly identifies merge commits and informs the user of the current limitation.
    *   All 12 tests in the suite are currently passing.
-   **Dependencies:** Python package dependencies (`click`, `pygit2==1.18.0`, `rich`, `pytest`) were installed and utilized during development and testing.

This work effectively completes the `revert` command implementation as per the original plan, within the constraints discovered with the `pygit2` library.

**Update: `gitwrite save` Command Testing**

Comprehensive testing for the `gitwrite save` command has been implemented, covering normal operations and conflict scenarios.

**1. Helper Fixtures and Functions:**
To support robust testing of the `save` command, the following helper fixtures and functions were added to `tests/test_main.py`:
-   **Fixtures:**
    -   `repo_with_unstaged_changes`: Creates a repository with a new file that has unstaged changes.
    -   `repo_with_staged_changes`: Creates a repository with a new file that has already been staged.
    -   `repo_with_merge_conflict`: Sets up a repository state where a merge conflict exists (MERGE_HEAD is present, and index has conflicts).
    -   `repo_with_revert_conflict`: Sets up a repository state where a revert operation has resulted in conflicts (REVERT_HEAD is present, and index has conflicts).
-   **Helper Functions:**
    -   `create_file(repo, filename, content)`: Utility to easily create a file in the test repository's working directory.
    -   `stage_file(repo, filename)`: Utility to stage a specified file.
    -   `resolve_conflict(repo, filename, resolved_content)`: Utility to simulate conflict resolution by writing resolved content to a file, adding it to the index, and removing the conflict entry from the index.

**2. Test Coverage for Normal Save Scenarios:**
A new test class, `TestGitWriteSaveNormalScenarios`, was added to `tests/test_main.py`. These tests cover standard `save` operations:
-   `test_save_new_file`: Verifies that a new, previously untracked and unstaged file is correctly committed with the given message.
-   `test_save_existing_file_modified`: Verifies that modifications to an existing, tracked file (unstaged) are committed.
-   `test_save_no_changes`: Checks that the `save` command correctly identifies when there are no changes to commit (neither in the working directory nor staged) and does not create an empty commit.
-   `test_save_staged_changes`: Ensures that changes already staged (e.g., via `git add` or a previous `gitwrite` operation that only staged) are properly committed.
-   `test_save_no_message`: Tests the behavior when a commit message is not provided with the `save` command. The test is designed to accommodate implementations where this might result in an error or the use of a default commit message.

**3. Test Coverage for Conflict Scenarios:**
A new test class, `TestGitWriteSaveConflictScenarios`, was added to `tests/test_main.py`. These tests focus on how `gitwrite save` behaves during and after merge and revert conflicts:
-   **Merge Conflicts:**
    -   `test_save_with_unresolved_merge_conflict`: Confirms that if `save` is invoked while there are unresolved merge conflicts (MERGE_HEAD exists), the command fails or warns the user, and no commit is made.
    -   `test_save_after_resolving_merge_conflict`: Verifies that after a merge conflict is manually resolved (simulated with `resolve_conflict` helper) and staged, `gitwrite save` successfully creates a merge commit. It also checks that the repository is no longer in a merge state (MERGE_HEAD is cleared).
-   **Revert Conflicts:**
    -   `test_save_with_unresolved_revert_conflict`: Confirms that if `save` is invoked while there are unresolved conflicts from a `gitwrite revert` operation (REVERT_HEAD exists), the command fails or warns the user, and the revert is not finalized.
    -   `test_save_after_resolving_revert_conflict`: Verifies that after a revert conflict is manually resolved and staged, `gitwrite save` successfully creates a commit that finalizes the revert. It checks that the commit message correctly reflects the revert and that the repository is no longer in a revert state (REVERT_HEAD is cleared).

**4. Test Status:**
-   All new tests for the `gitwrite save` command, covering both normal and conflict scenarios, are **passing**.

This suite of tests significantly improves the reliability and robustness of the `gitwrite save` command.

**CLI Command Updates and Fixes**

This section details recent updates and bug fixes made to specific GitWrite CLI commands based on testing and refinement.

1.  **`gitwrite revert <commit_ref>` Command (Merge Commit Handling):**
    *   **Limitation Confirmed & Test Updated:** The `gitwrite revert` command currently does not support reverting merge commits directly due to limitations in the underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` method (v1.18.0) for index-only reverts, especially when mainline parent selection is needed.
    *   The command will output a specific error message if a merge commit is targeted for revert.
    *   The test `test_revert_successful_merge_commit` in `tests/test_main.py` was updated to assert this expected error behavior, ensuring the CLI gracefully handles this scenario.

2.  **`gitwrite save` Command (During Revert with Unresolved Conflicts):**
    *   **Bug Fix:** A bug was identified where `gitwrite save`, when used during a revert operation that resulted in unresolved conflicts, was not providing the most specific error message. It would indicate generic unresolved conflicts rather than clearly stating it was due to the ongoing revert.
    *   **Resolution:** The `save` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was updated to explicitly check if `REVERT_HEAD` is present and if conflicts exist *before* attempting to stage all changes. If this condition is met, it now outputs a more precise error: "Error: Unresolved conflicts detected during revert." and instructs the user to resolve them before saving.
    *   The test `test_save_with_unresolved_revert_conflict` in `tests/test_main.py` now passes, verifying that this fix correctly identifies and reports the unresolved *revert* conflict.
