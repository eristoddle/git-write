**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Review and Forward Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a full review of the project state by comparing the `Implementation_Plan.md`, `Memory_Bank.md`, and the `writegit-project-doc.md`. While all tasks in the previous plan are complete, significant features from the project documentation are still missing. The implementation plan has been updated to address these gaps and create a clear path forward.

**Details:**
-   **Analysis:** The project has successfully implemented core functionalities, a CLI, a feature-rich API, and a corresponding SDK. The initial version of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has also been implemented.
-   **Identified Gaps:** Key features from the project documentation remain unimplemented. These include:
    1.  **Advanced Word-by-Word Diff as a Core Feature:** The current word-diff implementation is confined to the CLI's display logic. It needs to be refactored into a reusable core function and exposed via the API to support future web interfaces.
    2.  **Beta Reader Annotation Workflow:** The core logic for receiving, storing, and applying annotations from an EPUB reader is missing. This is a critical part of `FR-006`.
    3.  **Web Application & Mobile Application:** These major frontend components have not been started.
-   **New Plan:** A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated. It marks phases 1-9 as complete and introduces new phases for the remaining work, starting with enhancing the core/API features before tackling the UIs.

**Output/Result:**
-   Generated new `Implementation_Plan.md`.
-   Generated this log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Generated the prompt for the next agent session.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the first task of the new plan: **Task 10.1 - Core Word-by-Word Diff Engine**.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 10.1 - Agent_Core_Dev: Core Word-by-Word Diff Engine

**Summary:**
Successfully refactored the word-by-word diff logic from the CLI into a reusable core function and exposed it through an enhanced API endpoint. This enables a structured JSON representation of word-level differences, paving the way for a rich visual diff experience in the future web application.

**Details:**
1.  **Core Function (`gitwrite_core/versioning.py`):**
    *   Created a new function `get_word_level_diff(patch_text: str) -> List[Dict]`.
    *   This function parses a standard diff patch string.
    *   It adapts logic from `gitwrite_cli/main.py::process_hunk_lines_for_word_diff` but returns a structured JSON-serializable list of dictionaries instead of printing to the console.
    *   The returned structure delineates added, removed, and context parts at both line and word levels (e.g., `[{"file_path": "a.txt", "change_type": "modified", "hunks": [{"lines": [...]}]}]`).

2.  **API Endpoint (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    *   Modified the existing `GET /repository/compare` endpoint.
    *   Added an optional query parameter `diff_mode: Optional[str]`.
    *   If `diff_mode='word'`, the endpoint now calls `get_word_level_diff` and returns the structured JSON.
    *   Otherwise, it maintains its current behavior (raw patch text).
    *   Updated the `CompareRefsResponse` Pydantic model's `patch_text` field to `Union[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]` to support both response types.

3.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   Added new unit tests for `get_word_level_diff` in `tests/test_core_versioning.py`, covering various scenarios like additions, deletions, modifications, multiple files/hunks, empty patches, and renamed files.
    *   Updated unit tests for `GET /repository/compare` in `tests/test_api_repository.py` to cover both standard text-based diff and the new word-level structured diff via the `diff_mode` parameter.

**Output/Result:**
-   Core word-by-word diff engine implemented in `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`.
-   `GET /repository/compare` API endpoint enhanced to support word-level diffs.
-   `CompareRefsResponse` model updated.
-   Comprehensive unit tests added for the new core function and updated API endpoint.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 10.1 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 10.2 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 10.2 - Agent_Core_Dev: Core Annotation Handling

**Summary:**
Designed and implemented the core logic for creating, listing, and updating annotations. Each annotation and its status changes are stored as structured commits on a dedicated feedback branch, aligning with Git-native principles.

**Details:**
1.  **Data Model (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    *   Defined `AnnotationStatus` enum (`NEW`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`).
    *   Defined `Annotation` Pydantic model with fields: `id`, `file_path`, `highlighted_text`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `comment`, `author`, `status`, `commit_id`, and `original_annotation_id`.

2.  **Core Module (`gitwrite_core/annotations.py`):**
    *   Created the new module for all annotation-related logic.
    *   Implemented `_run_git_command` helper using `subprocess` for Git interactions.
    *   Added `AnnotationError` and `RepositoryOperationError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.

3.  **Annotation Committing (`create_annotation_commit`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path`, `feedback_branch`, and `Annotation` data.
    *   Ensures feedback branch exists (creates if not, based on current HEAD).
    *   Serializes annotation data (excluding `id`, `commit_id`) to YAML.
    *   Creates a new, empty Git commit (`--allow-empty`) on the feedback branch.
    *   Commit message: `Annotation: {file_path} (Lines {start_line}-{end_line})`.
    *   YAML data is stored in the commit body.
    *   Returns the SHA of the new annotation commit.
    *   Updates the input `Annotation` object's `id` and `commit_id` with the new SHA.

4.  **Annotation Listing (`list_annotations`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path` and `feedback_branch`.
    *   Parses `git log` output from the feedback branch (oldest to newest).
    *   Extracts YAML from commit message bodies.
    *   Reconstructs `Annotation` objects.
    *   Handles status update commits: If a commit updates a previous annotation (via `original_annotation_id` in its YAML), the function ensures the final list reflects the latest status and data for that annotation thread.
    *   The `id` of a listed `Annotation` is always the SHA of its original creation commit.
    *   The `commit_id` of a listed `Annotation` is the SHA of the commit that defines its current state (original or latest update).
    *   The `original_annotation_id` field in the `Annotation` model is populated if the annotation state comes from an update commit.
    *   Returns a `List[Annotation]`.

5.  **Status Updates (`update_annotation_status`):**
    *   Function takes `repo_path`, `feedback_branch`, `annotation_commit_id` (SHA of the original annotation), and `new_status`.
    *   Retrieves the data from the original annotation commit.
    *   Creates a new commit on the feedback branch.
    *   Commit message: `Update status: {file_path} (Annotation {short_orig_sha}) to {new_status}`.
    *   YAML body of this new commit includes all data from the original annotation, the `new_status`, and an `original_annotation_id` field pointing to the `annotation_commit_id` being updated.
    *   Returns the SHA of the status update commit.

6.  **Unit Tests (`tests/test_core_annotations.py`):**
    *   Created a new test file.
    *   Added `temp_git_repo` and `temp_empty_git_repo` pytest fixtures.
    *   Implemented comprehensive tests for `create_annotation_commit`, `list_annotations` (including handling of updates and non-annotation commits), and `update_annotation_status`.
    *   Covered success cases, error handling (e.g., invalid repo, non-existent branches/commits, malformed data), and edge cases (e.g., creating annotations in an empty repository).

**Output/Result:**
-   Core annotation handling logic implemented in `gitwrite_core/annotations.py`.
-   Pydantic models for annotations defined in `gitwrite_api/models.py`.
-   Custom exceptions added to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
-   Comprehensive unit tests created in `tests/test_core_annotations.py`.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 10.2 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 10.3 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 10.3 - Agent_API_Dev: API Endpoints for Annotations

**Summary:**
Implemented REST API endpoints for creating, listing, and updating annotations. This includes defining request/response models, creating a new API router, and writing comprehensive unit tests.

**Details:**
1.  **Pydantic Models (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    *   Added `CreateAnnotationRequest` for creating new annotations.
    *   Added `AnnotationResponse` (inheriting from `Annotation`) for single annotation responses.
    *   Added `AnnotationListResponse` for returning lists of annotations.
    *   Added `UpdateAnnotationStatusRequest` for updating an annotation's status.
    *   Added `UpdateAnnotationStatusResponse` for the response after an update.

2.  **API Router (`gitwrite_api/routers/annotations.py`):**
    *   Created a new router file dedicated to annotation endpoints, mounted at `/repository/annotations`.
    *   Implemented `POST /repository/annotations`:
        *   Accepts `CreateAnnotationRequest`.
        *   Calls `core_create_annotation_commit`.
        *   Returns `AnnotationResponse` with the created annotation.
    *   Implemented `GET /repository/annotations`:
        *   Accepts `feedback_branch` query parameter.
        *   Calls `core_list_annotations`.
        *   Returns `AnnotationListResponse`.
    *   Implemented `PUT /repository/annotations/{annotation_commit_id}`:
        *   Accepts `annotation_commit_id` path parameter and `UpdateAnnotationStatusRequest` body.
        *   Calls `core_update_annotation_status`.
        *   Retrieves the updated annotation state (using a helper that filters `core_list_annotations` output).
        *   Returns `UpdateAnnotationStatusResponse`.
    *   All endpoints include role-based authorization using `require_role` and appropriate error handling for core layer exceptions.

3.  **Router Registration (`gitwrite_api/main.py`):**
    *   Imported and registered the new `annotations_router` in the main FastAPI application.

4.  **Unit Tests (`tests/test_api_annotations.py`):**
    *   Created a new test file for annotation API endpoints.
    *   Used `TestClient` and `pytest`.
    *   Mocked core annotation functions (`core_create_annotation_commit`, `core_list_annotations`, `core_update_annotation_status`) and the internal helper `_get_annotation_by_original_id_from_list` to isolate API layer testing.
    *   Implemented tests for:
        *   Successful creation, listing, and status updates.
        *   Error handling for cases like repository/commit not found, branch not found, and other operational errors.
        *   Authorization checks (e.g., ensuring only users with appropriate roles can update status).
    *   Utilized a parameterized `mock_auth` fixture for managing authenticated user context in tests.

**Output/Result:**
-   API endpoints for annotations implemented in `gitwrite_api/routers/annotations.py`.
-   Associated Pydantic request/response models added to `gitwrite_api/models.py`.
-   New router registered in `gitwrite_api/main.py`.
-   Comprehensive unit tests created in `tests/test_api_annotations.py`.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 10.3 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the next task in Phase 11 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Fix failing unit test

**Summary:**
Fixed a failing unit test in `tests/test_api_annotations.py`. The test `test_update_annotation_status_annotation_not_found_after_update` was expecting a 404 status code, but the application was correctly returning a 500 status code to indicate an internal inconsistency.

**Details:**
1.  **Analysis:** The test was mocking a scenario where an annotation is successfully updated in the core logic, but then cannot be found when the API tries to retrieve it to return the updated state. The API router correctly identifies this as an internal server error (an inconsistency) and returns a 500 status code. The test, however, was asserting a 404.
2.  **Fix:**
    *   Modified `tests/test_api_annotations.py` to change the expected status code in `test_update_annotation_status_annotation_not_found_after_update` from 404 to 500.
    *   Adjusted the exception handling in `gitwrite_api/routers/annotations.py` to ensure that `HTTPException` is re-raised correctly, so it is not caught by the generic `except Exception` block.

**Output/Result:**
-   All unit tests now pass.
-   The `Implementation_Plan.md` and `Memory_Bank.md` have been updated to reflect the completion of Phase 10 and the start of Phase 11.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.1 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Expand Web App Implementation Plan

**Summary:**
Expanded the `Implementation_Plan.md` to provide a more detailed breakdown of the tasks required to build the web application, based on the features defined in `writegit-project-doc.md`.

**Details:**
-   **Analysis:** The previous implementation plan for the web application was too high-level, containing only a single task for setup and authentication.
-   **New Plan:** Expanded Phase 11 to include detailed tasks for:
    -   Project Dashboard and Repository Browser (Task 11.2)

    -   Visual Word-by-Word Diff Viewer (Task 11.4)
    -   Annotation Review Interface (Task 11.5)
    -   Selective Change Integration (Cherry-Picking) (Task 11.6)
    -   Branch Management (Task 11.7)

**Output/Result:**
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated with a more detailed breakdown of Phase 11.
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Jules to execute Task 11.1: Web App - Project Setup & Authentication.
---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 11.1 - Web App - Project Setup & Authentication

**Summary:**
Successfully initialized the React/TypeScript frontend project (`gitwrite-web`) and implemented a functional user authentication flow connecting to the existing API. This involved setting up the project structure, installing necessary dependencies, integrating the local `gitwrite-sdk`, creating login and dashboard components, and implementing protected routing.

**Details:**
1.  **Project Directory & Initialization:**
    *   Created a new top-level directory `gitwrite-web`.
    *   Initialized a new React project using Vite with the TypeScript template within `gitwrite-web` (`npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`).
    *   Installed initial npm dependencies.

2.  **Dependencies Installed:**
    *   `axios`: For making API calls (though `gitwrite-sdk` handles this, it's a common utility).
    *   `react-router-dom`: For handling application routing.
    *   `gitwrite-sdk`: Linked as a local file dependency (`file:../gitwrite_sdk`) in `package.json` and installed.

3.  **Login Flow (`gitwrite-web/src/components/Login.tsx`):**
    *   Created a `Login.tsx` component with username and password input fields and a login button.
    *   On form submission:
        *   Instantiates `GitWriteClient` from the `gitwrite-sdk` (API assumed at `http://localhost:8000`).
        *   Calls `client.login(username, password)`.
        *   On successful authentication, stores the JWT in `localStorage`.
        *   Redirects the user to `/dashboard` using `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom`.
        *   Displays an error message on login failure.
    *   Code Snippet (`Login.tsx` - simplified):
        ```tsx
        import React, { useState } from 'react';
        import { GitWriteClient } from 'gitwrite-sdk';
        import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

        const Login: React.FC = () => {
          // ... state for username, password, error
          const navigate = useNavigate();
          const handleSubmit = async (event: React.FormEvent) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            const client = new GitWriteClient('http://localhost:8000');
            try {
              const response = await client.login(username, password);
              if (response.access_token) {
                localStorage.setItem('jwtToken', response.access_token);
                navigate('/dashboard');
              } // ... error handling
            } catch (err) {
              // ... error handling
            }
          };
          return (/* ... form JSX ... */);
        };
        export default Login;
        ```

4.  **Protected Routing (`gitwrite-web/src/App.tsx`):**
    *   Created a placeholder `Dashboard.tsx` component.
    *   Set up routing in `App.tsx` using `react-router-dom`.
    *   Implemented a `ProtectedRoute` component that checks for the JWT in `localStorage`.
        *   If the token exists, it renders the child route (e.g., `Dashboard`).
        *   If not, it redirects to `/login`.
    *   The `/dashboard` route is wrapped by `ProtectedRoute`.
    *   The root path `/` redirects to `/login`.
    *   Code Snippet (`App.tsx` - routing structure):
        ```tsx
        import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Navigate, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
        import Login from './components/Login';
        import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';

        const ProtectedRoute: React.FC = () => {
          const isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem('jwtToken');
          return isAuthenticated ? <Outlet /> : <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
        };

        const App: React.FC = () => (
          <Router>
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
              <Route element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
                <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
              </Route>
              <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/login" replace />} />
            </Routes>
          </Router>
        );
        export default App;
        ```

**Output/Result:**
-   A new `gitwrite-web` directory at the project root containing a runnable React/Vite project.
-   A functional login page at `/login` that authenticates against the API (assuming the API is running and accessible).
-   A protected `/dashboard` route accessible only after successful login.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 11.1 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Initial difficulties with `run_in_bash_session` context and `cd` commands were resolved by chaining commands with `&&` or using `npm --prefix`.
-   The login functionality relies on the API server running at `http://localhost:8000`. This should be documented for developers running the web app.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.2: Web App - Project Dashboard and Repository Browser.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** APM Task Assignment: Resolve SDK Build and Configuration Issues

**Summary:**
Addressed several build and configuration issues in the `gitwrite-sdk` package. This involved renaming the Rollup configuration file, installing `tslib`, updating the Rollup configuration to handle type declarations and externalize `axios`, and modifying `package.json` to move `axios` to `peerDependencies`.

**Details:**
1.  **Module System Conflict:** Renamed `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.js` to `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs` to ensure Node.js treats it as an ES Module.
2.  **Missing Dependency:** Added `tslib` to `dependencies` in `gitwrite_sdk/package.json`.
3.  **Type Declaration Path Conflict & External Dependency:**
    *   Modified `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs`:
        *   Updated the TypeScript plugin options to `typescript({ declaration: true, declarationDir: undefined })` to resolve conflicts with `rollup-plugin-dts`.
        *   Added `external: ['axios']` to prevent bundling of `axios`.
4.  **SDK Dependency Classification:**
    *   Modified `gitwrite_sdk/package.json`:
        *   Removed `axios` from `dependencies`.
        *   Added `axios` to `peerDependencies`.

**Output/Result:**
-   `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.js` renamed to `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs`.
-   `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs` updated with new TypeScript plugin options and `axios` externalization.
-   `gitwrite_sdk/package.json` updated to include `tslib` as a dependency and `axios` as a peer dependency.
-   The `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` directory were intended to be updated via `npm install`, but this step repeatedly failed in the sandbox environment.
-   The build verification step (`npm run build`) also failed in the sandbox, preventing confirmation of a successful build and `dist` directory generation.

**Status:** Completed (with caveats regarding sandbox execution)

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Persistent failures with `npm install` and `npm run build` commands within the sandbox environment. This prevented full verification of the fixes and updates to `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`. The core configuration files were modified as requested.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
The user may need to manually run `npm install` and `npm run build` in the `gitwrite_sdk` directory in a local environment to fully verify the changes and generate the distributable files.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** APM Task Assignment: Finalize SDK Build Configuration

**Summary:**
Resolved a Rollup build error related to TypeScript declaration file generation in the `gitwrite-sdk`. The fix involved instructing the main TypeScript plugin (`@rollup/plugin-typescript`) to stop generating declaration files, delegating this responsibility entirely to `rollup-plugin-dts`.

**Details:**
1.  **Configuration Change (`gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs`):**
    *   In the first configuration object within the `plugins` array, the `typescript()` plugin options were modified.
    *   Changed `declaration: true` to `declaration: false`.
    *   To ensure full override of `tsconfig.json` settings which also specified `declarationDir`, `declarationDir: null` was explicitly added to the plugin options.
    *   The corrected line is: `plugins: [typescript({ declaration: false, declarationDir: null })],`

2.  **Verification Attempt:**
    *   Attempts to run `npm install` and `npm run build` within the `gitwrite_sdk` directory were made to verify the fix.
    *   Persistent environment issues with directory navigation (`cd gitwrite_sdk` failing) and/or `npm` execution context prevented successful execution of these verification commands.

**Output/Result:**
-   `gitwrite_sdk/rollup.config.mjs` updated to `plugins: [typescript({ declaration: false, declarationDir: null })]` in the relevant section.
-   Build verification could not be completed due to sandbox environment limitations. The change is based on the provided solution and error analysis.

**Status:** Completed (with caveats regarding build verification)

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Unable to verify the build fix by running `npm run build` due to persistent errors with `cd` and `npm` execution in the sandboxed bash environment.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
The user should run `npm install && npm run build` in the `gitwrite_sdk` directory in their local environment to confirm the resolution of the build error and the correct generation of the `dist` folder.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Fix API Login Request Format

**Summary:**
Modified the frontend login component (`gitwrite-web/src/components/Login.tsx`) to correctly pass credentials to the `gitwrite-sdk`'s `client.login` method. The method expects a single object argument (`{ username, password }`) rather than separate arguments.

**Details:**
1.  **Initial Analysis:** The task description indicated that the `Login.tsx` component was likely using `client.post()` which sends JSON, while the API's `/token` endpoint (using `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`) expects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data. The `client.login()` method from the SDK is designed to handle this correctly.
2.  **Code Inspection (`gitwrite-web/src/components/Login.tsx`):**
    *   Found that `client.login(username, password)` was already being used.
    *   However, the task description specified that `client.login()` expects a single object: `client.login({ username, password })`.
3.  **SDK Exploration (Attempted):**
    *   Attempted to verify the `client.login()` signature by inspecting the `gitwrite-sdk` source.
    *   The `gitwrite-sdk/src` directory and the root `gitwrite-sdk` directory appeared empty or lacked the necessary source files for direct inspection of the method signature.
4.  **Correction in `Login.tsx`:**
    *   Based on the task description's guidance for the correct `client.login()` signature, the call in `gitwrite-web/src/components/Login.tsx` was changed from:
        ```typescript
        const response = await client.login(username, password);
        ```
        to:
        ```typescript
        const response = await client.login({ username, password });
        ```
    *   This ensures the credentials are passed to the SDK login method in the expected object format.

**Output/Result:**
-   The `handleSubmit` function in `gitwrite-web/src/components/Login.tsx` was updated to call `client.login({ username, password })`.
-   This change aligns the frontend login request with the expected format for the SDK's `login` method, which should then correctly format the data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the API.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Unable to directly verify the `gitwrite-sdk`'s `client.login` method signature due to missing/inaccessible SDK source files in the provided environment. The fix relies on the accuracy of the task description regarding the method's expected parameters.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
-   Verify the login functionality by running the web application and API.
-   If the `gitwrite-sdk` source becomes available, confirm the `client.login` signature.

**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** UI Library Selection & Planning

**Summary:**
Selected Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS as the UI library and design system for the `gitwrite-web` application. This decision was made to ensure a flexible, modern, and themeable foundation for the UI, preventing future refactoring for theming or component customization.

**Details:**
-   **Analysis:** After completing the initial project setup and authentication flow, the next logical step was to establish the UI foundation. A theming-first approach was prioritized.
-   **Decision:** Chose Shadcn/UI over traditional component libraries (like MUI or Chakra UI).
-   **Rationale:**
    -   **Ownership:** Shadcn/UI provides component code that lives directly in our project, allowing for complete customization without fighting library styles.
    -   **Theming:** It is built on CSS variables and is designed for easy theming (e.g., light/dark mode, color palettes).
    -   **Flexibility:** It uses unstyled, accessible primitives (Radix UI) and a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind), which is ideal for building both standard and highly custom components (like the planned visual diff viewer).
-   **Next Action:** Updated the `Implementation_Plan.md` to insert a new task (Task 11.2) for integrating Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS. Prepared the prompt for Jules to execute this task.

**Output/Result:**
-   Generated this log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` with the new UI integration task and renumbered subsequent tasks.
-   Generated the prompt for Jules for Task 11.2.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Jules to execute Task 11.2: UI Library Integration (Shadcn/UI & Tailwind).
---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** APM Task Assignment: Integrate Shadcn/UI and Set Up Theming (Originally Task 11.2)

**Summary:**
Successfully integrated Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS into the `gitwrite-web` project. Implemented a theme provider and a theme toggle component, enabling light/dark mode switching.

**Details:**
1.  **Branching:**
    *   Created and worked on branch `feature/ui-library-theming`.

2.  **Tailwind CSS Setup:**
    *   Installed `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, and `@tailwindcss/vite`.
    *   Manually created `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` due to initial `npx tailwindcss init -p` failures.
    *   Updated `vite.config.ts` to use the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin.
    *   Updated `src/index.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";` and later, Shadcn/UI added its theme variables here.

3.  **Shadcn/UI Initialization:**
    *   Updated `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` with `baseUrl` and `paths` for import aliases (`@/components`, `@/lib/utils`).
    *   Updated `vite.config.ts` to include the resolve alias for `@`.
    *   Ran `npx shadcn@latest init --base-color slate --yes --force` to initialize Shadcn/UI.
        *   This created `components.json` with "slate" as the base color.
        *   Created `src/lib/utils.ts`.
        *   Updated `src/index.css` with CSS variables for the "slate" theme.

4.  **Theme Provider Implementation:**
    *   Created `src/components/theme-provider.tsx` with the provided logic for managing theme state (light, dark, system) and applying it to the HTML root.
    *   Wrapped the main `<App />` component in `src/main.tsx` with `<ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark" storageKey="vite-ui-theme">`.

5.  **Verification Components:**
    *   Added the Shadcn Button component (`npx shadcn@latest add button --yes`), creating `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
    *   Created `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` which uses `useTheme` and the Shadcn Button to provide a UI for toggling between light and dark modes.
    *   Updated `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` to include an instance of the `Button` and the `ThemeToggle`.

**Output/Result:**
-   `gitwrite-web` directory configured with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI (Slate theme).
-   `components.json`, `lib/utils.ts`, `components/ui/button.tsx`, `components/theme-provider.tsx`, and `components/ThemeToggle.tsx` created/updated.
-   `main.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` updated to use the theme provider and toggle.
-   A working light/dark mode toggle is implemented and ready for user verification on the dashboard.

**Status:** Completed (Pending user verification of UI functionality)

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Encountered initial difficulties with `npx tailwindcss init -p` and `npx shadcn@latest init` due to sandbox environment specifics and CLI interactivity. These were resolved by:
    -   Manually creating Tailwind config files.
    -   Using the `--force` and `--base-color` flags for `shadcn@latest init`.
    -   Correctly configuring `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts` for aliases and Tailwind v4/Vite plugin setup.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
User to pull the `feature/ui-library-theming` branch, run `npm install && npm run dev` in `gitwrite-web`, and verify the theme toggle functionality on the dashboard.

**Task Reference:** Fix PostCSS Configuration for Tailwind CSS (Follow-up to Shadcn/UI Integration)

**Summary:**
Resolved a Vite server startup error by updating the PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS. The error indicated that the Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin had moved to a separate package (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).

**Details:**
1.  **Error Identification:** The Vite development server failed to start with an error message: `[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use \`tailwindcss\` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install \`@tailwindcss/postcss\` and update your PostCSS configuration.`

2.  **Package Installation:**
    *   Installed the new required package: `npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss` in the `gitwrite-web` directory.

3.  **Configuration Update (`gitwrite-web/postcss.config.js`):**
    *   Modified `postcss.config.js` to use the new package.
    *   Changed:
        ```javascript
        // Old configuration
        plugins: {
          tailwindcss: {},
          autoprefixer: {},
        }
        ```
        to:
        ```javascript
        // New configuration
        plugins: {
          '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
          autoprefixer: {},
        }
        ```

**Output/Result:**
-   Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` dev dependency.
-   Updated `gitwrite-web/postcss.config.js` to reference `'@tailwindcss/postcss'`.
-   The Vite server is now expected to start without the PostCSS error.

**Status:** Completed (Pending user verification of Vite server startup)

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   The `npm run dev` command timed out in the sandbox, as expected for a dev server. Final verification of the fix (server starting without error) will be done by the user after pulling the changes.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
User to pull the `feature/ui-library-theming` branch, run `npm install && npm run dev` in `gitwrite-web`, and confirm the Vite server starts correctly without the PostCSS error.

**Task Reference:** Task 11.3 - Agent_Web_Dev: Project Dashboard and Repository Browser

**Summary:**
Developed the project dashboard and repository browser functionalities in the `gitwrite-web` application. This involved defining conceptual API endpoints, updating the SDK, creating new React components (`ProjectList`, `RepositoryBrowser`, `RepositoryStatus`), and integrating them into the existing application structure. Mock data is used for API responses pending backend implementation.

**Details:**
1.  **Conceptual API Definitions:**
    *   Defined `GET /repositories` to list projects.
        *   Response: `{"repositories": [{"name": "repo1", ...}]}`
    *   Defined `GET /repository/{repo_name}/tree/{ref}?path={dir_path}` to list files/folders.
        *   Response: `{"path": "...", "entries": [{"name": "file.txt", "type": "blob", ...}]}`

2.  **SDK Updates (`gitwrite_sdk`):**
    *   Added interfaces to `types.ts`: `RepositoryListItem`, `RepositoriesListResponse`, `RepositoryTreeEntry`, `RepositoryTreeBreadcrumbItem`, `RepositoryTreeResponse`.
    *   Added methods to `apiClient.ts`: `listRepositories()` and `listRepositoryTree()`.
    *   Exported new types from `index.ts`.

3.  **Frontend Component Development (`gitwrite-web/src/components/`):**
    *   `ProjectList.tsx`:
        *   Fetches and displays a list of (mocked) projects using `Card` and `Table` from Shadcn/UI.
        *   Handles loading and error states with `Skeleton` and `Alert`.
        *   Project items are clickable, navigating to the repository browser view.
        *   Uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for client instantiation.
    *   `RepositoryStatus.tsx`:
        *   Displays basic repository information like name and current branch (mocked).
        *   Uses `Card` and `lucide-react` icons.
    *   `RepositoryBrowser.tsx`:
        *   Fetches and displays a (mocked) file/folder tree for a selected repository.
        *   Uses `Table`, `Skeleton`, `Alert`, `Button`, and `lucide-react` icons.
        *   Implements breadcrumb navigation and "up a level" functionality.
        *   Integrates `RepositoryStatus` component.
        *   Parses `repoName` and `*` (splatPath) from URL parameters.
        *   Handles navigation for folders and placeholder action for files.

4.  **Integration (`gitwrite-web/src/`):**
    *   `components/Dashboard.tsx`: Modified to display the `ProjectList` component as its main content.
    *   `App.tsx`:
        *   Added a new protected route: `/repository/:repoName/*` that renders `RepositoryBrowser`.
        *   Updated the root path `/` to default to `/dashboard`.
        *   Included a basic `AppLayout` component for authenticated views.

5.  **Styling and UI:**
    *   Leveraged Shadcn/UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
    *   Ensured loading states (skeletons) and error messages (alerts) are implemented.
    *   Basic interactive elements (hover states, clickable rows) are included.

**Output/Result:**
-   New SDK methods and types for project and file browsing.
-   New React components: `ProjectList.tsx`, `RepositoryBrowser.tsx`, `RepositoryStatus.tsx`.
-   Updated `Dashboard.tsx` and `App.tsx` to integrate the new features and routes.
-   The UI now presents a (mocked) list of projects and allows browsing their (mocked) file structures.

**Status:** Completed (Frontend uses mock data; backend API endpoints are conceptual and not yet implemented).

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   The functionality relies on conceptual API endpoints (`GET /repositories` and `GET /repository/{repo_name}/tree/{ref}`) that are not yet implemented in the backend. The frontend uses mock data in their place.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
-   Implement the backend API endpoints for listing repositories and repository trees.
-   Replace mock data fetching in frontend components with actual API calls using the SDK.
-   Proceed with Task 11.4 (Commit History and File Content Viewer).

**Task Reference:** Fix Vite Import Resolution for Shadcn/UI Components

**Summary:**
Resolved a Vite import analysis error (`Failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/card"`) by adding the missing Shadcn/UI components to the `gitwrite-web` project. Path aliases were verified to be correct.

**Details:**
1.  **Error Identification:** User reported a Vite error indicating failure to resolve imports like ` "@/components/ui/card"` from `ProjectList.tsx`.

2.  **Path Alias Verification:**
    *   Checked `gitwrite-web/tsconfig.json`, `gitwrite-web/tsconfig.app.json`, and `gitwrite-web/vite.config.ts`.
    *   Confirmed that the `@/*` alias was correctly configured to point to `./src/*`. This ruled out alias misconfiguration as the root cause.

3.  **Check for Existing UI Components:**
    *   Listed contents of `gitwrite-web/src/components/ui/`.
    *   Found only `button.tsx` was present, indicating other components (card, table, etc.) were not added.

4.  **Add Missing Shadcn/UI Components:**
    *   Used `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name> --cwd ./gitwrite-web --yes` to add the following components:
        *   `card`
        *   `table`
        *   `skeleton`
        *   `alert`
        *   `dropdown-menu` (proactive addition for general UI needs)
        *   `label` (proactive, for potential form styling)
        *   `input` (proactive, for potential form styling)
    *   Corrected the command from `shadcn-ui@latest` to `shadcn@latest` as per CLI deprecation message.

5.  **Conceptual Verification:**
    *   Reviewed imports in `ProjectList.tsx`, `RepositoryBrowser.tsx`, `Login.tsx`, and `ThemeToggle.tsx`.
    *   Confirmed that the newly added components would satisfy the import requirements, resolving the Vite error.

**Output/Result:**
-   Added `card.tsx`, `table.tsx`, `skeleton.tsx`, `alert.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and `input.tsx` to `gitwrite-web/src/components/ui/`.
-   The Vite import resolution error should now be fixed.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
-   User to re-run `npm run dev` in `gitwrite-web` to confirm the fix.
-   Continue with the overall project plan.

**Task Reference:** Fix SDK Export Issue for New Types

**Summary:**
Addressed a Vite/SDK import error (`SyntaxError: ... does not provide an export named 'RepositoriesListResponse'`) by rebuilding the `gitwrite-sdk`. The source files for SDK types and exports were verified to be correct prior to the rebuild.

**Details:**
1.  **Error Identification:** User reported a Vite error in `ProjectList.tsx` indicating that `RepositoriesListResponse` (and likely other new types) could not be imported from the SDK's `dist/esm/index.js`.

2.  **Verify SDK Source Exports:**
    *   Checked `gitwrite_sdk/src/types.ts`: Confirmed `RepositoriesListResponse`, `RepositoryListItem`, `RepositoryTreeResponse`, etc., were correctly defined and exported.
    *   Checked `gitwrite_sdk/src/index.ts`: Confirmed these types were correctly re-exported from `./types`.
    *   This indicated the source was correct, and the issue likely stemmed from an outdated or incorrect SDK build.

3.  **Attempt to Rebuild SDK:**
    *   Ran `npm install --prefix gitwrite_sdk` to ensure dependencies were current.
    *   Ran `npm run build --prefix gitwrite_sdk` (which executes `rollup -c`).
    *   The build process completed successfully without errors, generating new files in the `gitwrite_sdk/dist/` directory (including `dist/esm/index.js` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`).

4.  **Conceptual Inspection of `dist` Output:**
    *   Based on the successful rebuild after verifying correct source exports, it was concluded that the new types should now be correctly included and exported in the generated `dist` files.

5.  **Troubleshooting Step (Skipped):**
    *   Since the build was successful, active troubleshooting of Rollup/TypeScript configurations for the SDK was deemed unnecessary at this stage. The primary hypothesis was that the web app was using an SDK build generated before the new types were added.

**Output/Result:**
-   Successfully rebuilt the `gitwrite-sdk`.
-   The `gitwrite_sdk/dist` files were updated.
-   It is anticipated that the Vite import error for `RepositoriesListResponse` and related types in `gitwrite-web` is now resolved.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
-   User to re-run `npm run dev --prefix gitwrite-web` to confirm the SDK export fix and that the web application now runs without the import error.
-   If the error persists, further investigation into the SDK build process or Vite's module resolution for linked local packages might be needed.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 11.4 - Agent_Web_Dev: Commit History and File Content Viewer

**Summary:**
Implemented features for viewing commit history and file content within the web application. This involved creating a new API endpoint to fetch file content at a specific commit, updating the SDK, and developing new frontend components.

**Details:**
1.  **API Endpoint & Core Function (`GET /repository/file-content`):**
    *   **Core Function (`gitwrite_core/repository.py::get_file_content_at_commit`):**
        *   Created `get_file_content_at_commit(repo_path_str, file_path, commit_sha_str)`.
        *   Uses `pygit2` to retrieve file blob data, size, mode, and determine if binary.
        *   Handles errors like repo/commit/file not found.
    *   **API Endpoint (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
        *   Added `GET /repository/file-content` endpoint.
        *   Accepts `file_path` and `commit_sha` query parameters.
        *   Calls the new core function and returns `FileContentResponse`.
    *   **Models (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
        *   Added `FileContentResponse` Pydantic model.
    *   **Unit Tests:**
        *   Added tests for `get_file_content_at_commit` in `tests/test_core_repository.py`.
        *   Added tests for the `GET /repository/file-content` endpoint in `tests/test_api_repository.py`.

2.  **SDK Updates (`gitwrite_sdk`):**
    *   **Types (`src/types.ts`):** Added `FileContentResponse` interface.
    *   **Client (`src/apiClient.ts`):** Added `getFileContent(repoName, filePath, commitSha)` method.
    *   **Exports (`src/index.ts`):** Exported `FileContentResponse`.
    *   Rebuilt the SDK.

3.  **Frontend Components (`gitwrite-web`):**
    *   **`CommitHistoryView.tsx`:**
        *   Fetches and displays commit history for a branch using `client.listCommits()`.
        *   Allows selection of a commit, navigating to the `RepositoryBrowser` to view the tree at that commit's state (`/repository/:repoName/tree/:commitSha/`).
    *   **`FileContentViewer.tsx`:**
        *   Displays file content fetched using `client.getFileContent()`.
        *   Includes syntax highlighting using `react-syntax-highlighter`.
    *   **`pages/FileContentViewerPage.tsx`:**
        *   Wrapper component to parse URL parameters (`repoName`, `commitSha`, `filePath`) and pass them to `FileContentViewer.tsx`.
    *   **`App.tsx` (Routing):**
        *   Added route `/repository/:repoName/history/*` for `CommitHistoryView`.
        *   Added route `/repository/:repoName/commit/:commitSha/file/*` for `FileContentViewerPage`.
    *   **`RepositoryBrowser.tsx` Updates:**
        *   Added "View History" button linking to `CommitHistoryView` for the current branch.
        *   Modified file click handler to navigate to `FileContentViewerPage`, using the latest commit SHA of the current branch (fetched via `client.listCommits({ maxCount: 1 })`).
        *   Adapted to interpret the ref in its URL (`/repository/:repoName/tree/:ref/*`) as either a branch name or a commit SHA, allowing it to display the tree for a specific commit.
    *   **`RepositoryStatus.tsx` Updates:**
        *   Modified to display whether the current view is for a branch or a specific commit.

**Output/Result:**
-   New API endpoint and core logic for fetching file content.
-   Updated SDK with the new functionality.
-   New frontend components for commit history and file viewing.
-   Enhanced existing frontend components (`RepositoryBrowser`, `RepositoryStatus`, `App.tsx`) to integrate the new views and logic.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   `RepositoryBrowser.tsx` still uses mock data for its primary tree listing function. This is outside the scope of the current task but will need to be addressed when its corresponding backend API is implemented.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.5 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
---
**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 11.5 - Agent_Web_Dev: Visual Word-by-Word Diff Viewer

**Summary:**
Implemented a visual word-by-word diff viewer in the web application. This feature allows users to compare a commit with its parent and see detailed, highlighted changes at both line and word levels. The SDK was updated to support structured diff data, and new frontend components were created for fetching, displaying, and routing to the diff view.

**Details:**
1.  **SDK Updates (`gitwrite_sdk`):**
    *   Defined TypeScript interfaces (`StructuredDiffFile`, `WordDiffHunk`, `WordDiffLine`, `WordDiffSegment`) in `src/types.ts` for the structured JSON output of the word-level diff API.
    *   Updated `CompareRefsResponse` in `src/types.ts`: `patch_text` field changed to `patch_data: string | StructuredDiffFile[]`.
    *   Updated `CompareRefsParams` in `src/types.ts` to include `diff_mode?: 'text' | 'word'`.
    *   Modified `compareRefs` method in `src/apiClient.ts` to pass the `diff_mode` query parameter and handle the updated response type.
    *   Exported the new diff-related types from `src/index.ts`.
    *   Rebuilt the SDK.

2.  **Frontend - Commit History View (`gitwrite-web/src/components/CommitHistoryView.tsx`):**
    *   Added a "Compare to Parent" button to each commit in the history list (disabled for initial commits).
    *   On click, this button navigates to a new route (`/repository/:repoName/compare/:parentSha/:currentSha`) dedicated to showing the diff.

3.  **Frontend - Diff Viewer Components (`gitwrite-web`):**
    *   Created `WordDiffDisplay.tsx`: A component that takes structured diff data and renders it.
        *   Displays file paths (handles renames/copies).
        *   Shows messages for binary files or non-content changes.
        *   Renders hunks and lines with appropriate background colors for additions (green) and deletions (red).
        *   Within changed lines, highlights individual added/removed words with stronger background colors and appropriate text styling (e.g., strikethrough for removed).
    *   Created `WordDiffViewerPage.tsx`: A page component that:
        *   Parses repository name and commit SHAs (`ref1`, `ref2`) from URL parameters.
        *   Fetches the structured diff data using `client.compareRefs({ ref1, ref2, diff_mode: 'word' })`.
        *   Manages loading and error states.
        *   Renders the `WordDiffDisplay` component with the fetched data.
        *   Includes a back button and displays the SHAs being compared.

4.  **Frontend - Routing (`gitwrite-web/src/App.tsx`):**
    *   Added a new route `/repository/:repoName/compare/:ref1/:ref2` that maps to `WordDiffViewerPage.tsx`.

5.  **Post-implementation Fix (User Feedback):**
    *   Corrected an issue where new SDK types (`StructuredDiffFile`, `WordDiffHunk`, `WordDiffLine`, `WordDiffSegment`) were defined but not exported from `gitwrite_sdk/src/index.ts`, causing TypeScript errors in the web app. Updated exports and rebuilt SDK.
    *   Ensured `WordDiffDisplay.tsx` correctly imports all necessary types from the SDK.


**Output/Result:**
-   SDK updated to handle structured word-level diffs.
-   Web application now features a visual diff viewer accessible from the commit history page.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 11.5 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Initial test runs for backend failed due to environment issues (missing `pygit2`, missing `pandoc`). These are considered pre-existing or environment-specific and not regressions from this task. User confirmed Python tests pass in their correct environment.
-   The full end-to-end testing of this feature in the web app relies on the `GET /repository/compare` API endpoint being functional and the preceding UI views (project list, repo browser, commit history) being able to provide live data or a path to trigger the comparison.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.6 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 11.6 - Agent_Web_Dev: Annotation Review Interface

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented the Annotation Review Interface in the `gitwrite-web` application. This involved updating the `gitwrite-sdk` with new types and methods for annotation handling, creating an `AnnotationSidebar` React component to display and manage annotations, and integrating this sidebar into the existing `FileContentViewer` component. Users can now view annotations relevant to a file and update their status (Accept/Reject).

**Details:**
1.  **SDK Updates (`gitwrite_sdk`):**
    *   Added TypeScript interfaces/enums to `src/types.ts`: `AnnotationStatus`, `Annotation`, `AnnotationListResponse`, `UpdateAnnotationStatusRequest`, `UpdateAnnotationStatusResponse`, `CreateAnnotationRequest`, `CreateAnnotationResponse`.
    *   Added methods to `src/apiClient.ts`: `listAnnotations(repoName, feedbackBranch)` and `updateAnnotationStatus(annotationCommitId, payload)`. Also added `createAnnotation` for completeness.
    *   Exported new types from `src/index.ts`.
    *   Rebuilt the SDK successfully.

2.  **Frontend - `AnnotationSidebar.tsx` (`gitwrite-web`):**
    *   Created a new component to display a list of annotations filtered for the `currentFilePath`.
    *   Each annotation card shows author, comment, highlighted text, and status (as a badge).
    *   Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons, calling a prop function `onUpdateStatus`.
    *   Manages loading states for individual status updates.
    *   Uses Shadcn UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `ScrollArea`).

3.  **Frontend - `FileContentViewer.tsx` (`gitwrite-web`):**
    *   Modified to fetch annotations for a given `feedbackBranch` (prop added, initially hardcoded in page) in parallel with file content.
    *   Manages state for annotations, loading, and errors related to annotations.
    *   Implements `handleUpdateAnnotationStatus` to call the SDK's `updateAnnotationStatus` method and then refreshes the annotation list.
    *   Renders the `AnnotationSidebar`, passing down annotations, the update handler, loading state, and the current file path.
    *   Adjusted overall layout to a two-column view (file content and annotation sidebar).

4.  **Frontend - `FileContentViewerPage.tsx` (`gitwrite-web`):**
    *   Updated to pass a hardcoded `feedbackBranch="feedback/main"` prop to `FileContentViewer`.

**Output/Result:**
-   SDK enhanced for annotation interactions.
-   Web application now has an interface for viewing and managing annotations alongside file content.
-   The `feedbackBranch` is currently hardcoded, suggesting a future enhancement for dynamic selection.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   Full end-to-end manual testing was limited by the lack of a running backend with pre-existing annotations in the development environment. Verification was based on code compilation, successful dev server startup, and conceptual review.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.7 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Jules (Software Engineer AI)
**Task Reference:** Task 11.7 - Agent_Web_Dev: Selective Change Integration (Cherry-Picking)

**Summary:**
Implemented an interface in the `gitwrite-web` application for reviewing commits from a specific branch and selectively cherry-picking them into the current working branch (conceptually 'main'). This involved creating a new page to list reviewable commits, allowing users to view diffs for each, and triggering the cherry-pick operation with UI feedback for success, conflicts, or errors.

**Details:**
1.  **New Frontend Page (`gitwrite-web/src/pages/BranchReviewPage.tsx`):**
    *   Created a new page that takes `repoName` and `branchName` (the branch to review) as URL parameters.
    *   Fetches commits unique to the specified `branchName` (compared to the current repository HEAD) using `client.reviewBranch()`.
    *   Displays these commits in a table, each with:
        *   A "View Diff" button: Navigates to `WordDiffViewerPage`, showing the changes introduced by that commit (commit vs. its parent).
        *   A "Cherry-Pick" button.
    *   Handles loading and error states for fetching commits.

2.  **Cherry-Pick Logic (`BranchReviewPage.tsx`):**
    *   The "Cherry-Pick" button calls `client.cherryPickCommit()` with the selected commit's OID.
    *   Manages loading state for the cherry-pick action on a per-commit basis.
    *   Displays an `Alert` message for:
        *   **Success:** Shows the new commit SHA and refreshes the list of reviewable commits (successfully picked commits should no longer appear).
        *   **Conflict:** Shows the error message from the API and lists conflicting files, guiding the user to resolve them manually.
        *   **Other Errors:** Shows the error message from the API.
    *   Includes a "Refresh List" button to manually update the list of reviewable commits.

3.  **Navigation and Integration:**
    *   **`RepositoryStatus.tsx`:**
        *   Modified to accept `allBranches` (list of all branches for the repo) and `repoName` props.
        *   Added a "Review for Cherry-Pick" `DropdownMenu`.
        *   This dropdown lists all branches except the `currentBranch` being viewed in `RepositoryBrowser`.
        *   Selecting a branch from this dropdown navigates to `/repository/:repoName/review-branch/:selectedBranchName`.
    *   **`RepositoryBrowser.tsx`:**
        *   Fetches the list of all branches for the current repository using `client.listBranches()`.
        *   Passes `allBranches` and `repoName` to the `RepositoryStatus` component.
    *   **`App.tsx` (Routing):**
        *   Added a new route `/repository/:repoName/review-branch/:branchName/*` that renders `BranchReviewPage.tsx`.

4.  **Diff View Context:**
    *   The existing `WordDiffViewerPage` is used to show the diff of a commit against its parent (`commit.oid^`), which is suitable for understanding the changes before cherry-picking. No changes to the diff viewer component itself were required for this task.

**Output/Result:**
-   New `BranchReviewPage.tsx` created.
-   Cherry-pick functionality integrated into the UI with feedback mechanisms.
-   Navigation to the review page implemented via a dropdown in `RepositoryStatus.tsx`.
-   Routing updated in `App.tsx`.
-   `Implementation_Plan.md` updated to mark Task 11.7 as complete.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
-   The UI text in `BranchReviewPage.tsx` currently assumes the target for cherry-picking is 'main'. The actual backend operation targets the repository's current HEAD. This is a known simplification for this task and can be enhanced later for dynamic target branch selection.
-   Manual end-to-end testing was conceptual due to environment limitations.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 11.8 as per the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
