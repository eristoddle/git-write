**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Project Refactoring Strategy

**Summary:**
Initiating a strategic refactoring of the GitWrite CLI project. The primary goal is to separate the core Git logic from the command-line interface implementation. This will be achieved by creating a new `gitwrite_core` library to house all business logic, making the existing `gitwrite_cli` a thin presentation layer.

**Details:**
- **Problem:** The current project structure in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` tightly couples the core logic (interactions with `pygit2`) with the presentation logic (`click` commands). This is perfectly fine for an MVP but presents challenges for future development, specifically for the planned REST API, which would require duplicating code or creating a messy dependency on the CLI module.
- **Solution:** A new `gitwrite_core` package will be created. All complex logic will be moved into functions within this library. These functions will be designed to be pure and reusable: they will take parameters, perform actions, and either return data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) or raise specific, custom exceptions (e.g., `CommitNotFoundError`).
- **Benefit:** This "Separation of Concerns" will make the code more modular, easier to test, and crucially, allows both the `gitwrite_cli` and the future `gitwrite_api` to use the same robust, tested `gitwrite_core` library without code duplication.
- **Process:** The refactoring will be done incrementally, command by command, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`, to ensure the project remains in a working state throughout the process.

**Output/Result:**
- A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated to guide the refactoring effort.
- This `Memory_Bank.md` entry has been created to log the strategic decision and rationale.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.1 of the new Implementation Plan: setting up the `gitwrite_core` project structure.
