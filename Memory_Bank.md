**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Status Re-evaluation and Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a comprehensive review of the GitWrite project to validate the completion of Phase 6 (API Feature Parity). The analysis revealed several gaps between the project documentation (`writegit-project-doc.md`), the CLI features, and the implemented REST API. The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been significantly updated to reflect the true project status and provide a more detailed roadmap for achieving full feature parity and implementing advanced features.

**Details:**
- **Analysis Findings:**
    - The API is **missing a crucial `init` endpoint** for repository creation, which is available in the CLI.
    - Advanced features specified in `writegit-project-doc.md` are missing from all components (core, CLI, API). These include:
        - Selective Change Integration (cherry-picking).
        - Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB export and annotation handling).
        - Full Publishing Workflow Support (granular RBAC).
- **Corrective Actions:**
    - The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been rewritten.
    - Phase 6 is now correctly marked as "In Progress" and focuses on the remaining API feature gaps, starting with the `init` endpoint.
    - New phases (Phase 7: Advanced Collaboration, Phase 8: SDK Development, Phase 9: Publishing Workflows) have been added and detailed to provide a clear, structured path forward. This addresses the concern about skipping features by breaking them down into verifiable tasks.
- **Project State:** The project is now poised to begin work on the first task of the revised Phase 6.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (content completely replaced with a new, detailed plan).
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.1: Repository Initialization Endpoint, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 6, Task 6.1: Repository Initialization Endpoint

**Summary:**
Implemented the `POST /repositories` API endpoint to allow clients to initialize new GitWrite repositories. This functionality mirrors the `gitwrite init` CLI command. The endpoint supports creating a repository with a specific project name or generating a unique ID if no name is provided. It integrates with the existing `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository` function and includes comprehensive error handling and unit tests.

**Details:**
-   **API Endpoint Implementation (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Created `POST /repositories` endpoint.
    -   Request body uses `RepositoryCreateRequest` model (from `gitwrite_api/models.py`) with an optional `project_name: str`.
        -   If `project_name` is provided, it's used as the directory name under `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH/gitwrite_user_repos/`.
        -   If `project_name` is not provided, a UUID is generated and used as the directory name under `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH/gitwrite_user_repos/`.
    -   Response model is `RepositoryCreateResponse`, returning `status`, `message`, `repository_id`, and `path`.
    -   Endpoint is protected by `get_current_active_user` dependency.
    -   Handles responses from `core_initialize_repository`:
        -   `201 Created`: On successful initialization.
        -   `409 Conflict`: If the repository directory already exists and is not a valid target (e.g., non-empty, non-Git directory, or a conflicting file name).
        -   `500 Internal Server Error`: For other core errors or issues like inability to create base directories.
-   **Pydantic Models:**
    -   `gitwrite_api/models.py`: Added `RepositoryCreateRequest(BaseModel)`.
        ```python
        class RepositoryCreateRequest(BaseModel):
            project_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=1, pattern=r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$", description="Optional name for the repository. If provided, it will be used as the directory name. Must be alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores.")
        ```
    -   `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`: Added `RepositoryCreateResponse(BaseModel)`.
        ```python
        class RepositoryCreateResponse(BaseModel):
            status: str = Field(..., description="Outcome of the repository creation operation (e.g., 'created').")
            message: str = Field(..., description="Detailed message about the creation outcome.")
            repository_id: str = Field(..., description="The ID or name of the created repository.")
            path: str = Field(..., description="The server path to the created repository.")
        ```
-   **Key Endpoint Snippet (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    ```python
    @router.post("/repositories", response_model=RepositoryCreateResponse, status_code=201)
    async def api_initialize_repository(
        request_data: RepositoryCreateRequest,
        current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
    ):
        repo_base_path = Path(PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH) / "gitwrite_user_repos"
        project_name_to_use: str
        if request_data.project_name:
            project_name_to_use = request_data.project_name
            core_project_name_arg = request_data.project_name
            core_path_str_arg = str(repo_base_path)
        else:
            project_name_to_use = str(uuid.uuid4())
            core_project_name_arg = None
            core_path_str_arg = str(repo_base_path / project_name_to_use)

        repo_base_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) # Simplified try-catch not shown

        result = core_initialize_repository(
            path_str=core_path_str_arg,
            project_name=core_project_name_arg
        )
        # ... (response handling logic) ...
    ```
-   **Unit Test Implementation (`tests/test_api_repository.py`):**
    -   Added new test functions for `POST /repository/repositories`.
    -   Mocked `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository` and `uuid.uuid4`.
    -   Tested scenarios:
        -   Successful creation with project name (201).
        -   Successful creation without project name (UUID used, 201).
        -   Attempting to create where a directory/file conflict occurs (409).
        -   Core function generic error (500).
        -   Base directory creation OS error (500).
        -   Unauthorized request (401).
        -   Invalid payload (e.g., invalid project name characters, empty project name) (422).
-   **Key Unit Test Snippet (`tests/test_api_repository.py` for success with project name):**
    ```python
    @patch('gitwrite_api.routers.repository.core_initialize_repository')
    @patch('gitwrite_api.routers.repository.uuid.uuid4')
    def test_api_initialize_repository_with_project_name_success(mock_uuid4, mock_core_init_repo):
        app.dependency_overrides[actual_repo_auth_dependency] = mock_get_current_active_user
        project_name = "test-project"
        expected_repo_path = f"{MOCK_REPO_PATH}/gitwrite_user_repos/{project_name}"

        mock_core_init_repo.return_value = {
            "status": "success",
            "message": f"Repository '{project_name}' initialized.",
            "path": expected_repo_path
        }
        payload = RepositoryCreateRequest(project_name=project_name)
        response = client.post("/repository/repositories", json=payload.model_dump())

        assert response.status_code == HTTPStatus.CREATED
        data = response.json()
        assert data["status"] == "created"
        assert data["repository_id"] == project_name
        # ... more assertions ...
        app.dependency_overrides = {}
    ```
-   **Testing Confirmation:** All new unit tests passed successfully.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/models.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
-   Modified `tests/test_api_repository.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the next task as assigned by the Project Manager.

**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.2 - Agent_CLI_Dev: Cherry-Pick CLI Commands

**Summary:**
Implemented two new CLI commands: `gitwrite review <branch>` and `gitwrite cherry-pick <commit_id>`.
The `review` command lists commits on a specified branch that are not present in the current HEAD, aiding in understanding changes before potential integration.
The `cherry-pick` command allows applying a specific commit from any part of the history to the current branch.
Core logic for reviewing branches was added, and comprehensive unit tests for both CLI commands were implemented.

**Details:**
-   **Core Logic for Review (`gitwrite_core/versioning.py`):**
    -   Added new function `get_branch_review_commits(repo_path_str: str, branch_name_to_review: str, limit: Optional[int] = None) -> List[Dict]`.
    -   This function identifies commits on the `branch_name_to_review` that are not ancestors of the current `HEAD`.
    -   It returns a list of commit data (hash, author, date, message) suitable for display.
    -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError`, `BranchNotFoundError`.
    -   Added `BranchNotFoundError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
-   **CLI Command `gitwrite review <branch_name>` (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    -   Takes a `branch_name` argument and an optional `-n/--number` limit.
    -   Calls `core.get_branch_review_commits`.
    -   Displays results in a `rich.table.Table`.
    -   Handles exceptions and provides user-friendly error messages.
-   **CLI Command `gitwrite cherry-pick <commit_id>` (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    -   Takes a `commit_id` argument and an optional `--mainline <num>` integer option.
    -   Calls `core.cherry_pick_commit`.
    -   Displays success message with new commit OID or error messages.
    -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError`, `CommitNotFoundError`, `MergeConflictError` (listing conflicting files), and other `GitWriteError` exceptions.
-   **Unit Tests (`tests/test_cli_review_cherry_pick.py`):**
    -   Created a new test file for these commands.
    -   **`review` command tests:**
        -   Successful listing of unique commits.
        -   Branch not found.
        -   No unique commits.
        -   Non-Git repository.
        -   Usage of `--number` limit.
    -   **`cherry-pick` command tests:**
        -   Successful cherry-pick.
        -   Cherry-pick with conflicts.
        -   Commit not found.
        -   Cherry-picking a merge commit (with and without mainline, valid/invalid mainline).
        -   Non-Git repository.
        -   Generic `GitWriteError` from core.
    -   Tests mock core functions and assert CLI output and exit codes.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_cli/main.py`
-   Created `tests/test_cli_review_cherry_pick.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.2 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 7.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Cherry-Pick API Endpoints.

---
**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Phase 7, Task 7.3 - Agent_API_Dev: Cherry-Pick API Endpoints

**Summary:**
Implemented API endpoints to support reviewing commits on a branch and cherry-picking specific commits.
A `GET /repository/review/{branch_name}` endpoint was created to list commits on a specified branch not present in the current HEAD, facilitating review before integration.
A `POST /repository/cherry-pick` endpoint was created to apply a specific commit to the current branch, supporting an optional `mainline` parameter for merge commits.
These endpoints leverage the corresponding core functions. Pydantic models for requests and responses were defined, and comprehensive unit tests were added.

**Details:**
-   **Pydantic Models (`gitwrite_api/models.py`):**
    -   Added `CherryPickRequest(BaseModel)`: with `commit_id: str` and `mainline: Optional[int]`.
    -   Added `CherryPickResponse(BaseModel)`: with `status: str`, `message: str`, `new_commit_oid: Optional[str]`, and `conflicting_files: Optional[List[str]]`.
    -   Added `BranchReviewCommit(BaseModel)`: with `short_hash: str`, `author_name: str`, `date: str`, `message_short: str`, `oid: str`.
    -   Added `BranchReviewResponse(BaseModel)`: with `status: str`, `branch_name: str`, `commits: List[BranchReviewCommit]`, `message: str`.

    -   Accepts `branch_name` path parameter and optional `limit` query parameter.
    -   Calls `core_get_branch_review_commits` from `gitwrite_core.versioning`.
    -   Returns `BranchReviewResponse` (200 OK).
    -   Handles `BranchNotFoundError` (404), `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500), `GitWriteError` (e.g., unborn HEAD - 400, other 500).
-   **API Endpoint `POST /repository/cherry-pick` (`gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`):**
    -   Accepts `CherryPickRequest` in the body.
    -   Calls `core_cherry_pick_commit` from `gitwrite_core.versioning`.
    -   Returns `CherryPickResponse` (200 OK).
        -   Handles successful cherry-pick.
        -   Handles conflicts by returning `status="conflict"` and `conflicting_files`.
        -   Handles `CommitNotFoundError` (404).
        -   Handles `RepositoryNotFoundError` (500).
        -   Handles `GitWriteError` for issues like unborn HEAD, missing/invalid mainline for merge commits (400).
-   **Unit Tests (`tests/test_api_cherry_pick.py`):**
    -   Created a new test file for these API endpoints.
    -   **Review endpoint tests:** Success, with limit, no unique commits, branch not found, repo not found, unborn HEAD, unauthorized.
    -   **Cherry-pick endpoint tests:** Success, success with mainline, conflict, commit not found, merge commit without mainline, invalid mainline, unborn HEAD, repo not found, generic GitWriteError, unauthorized, invalid payloads.
    -   Mocked core functions and asserted responses and status codes.
    -   Installed `pytest`, `pygit2`, `click`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `rich`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-multipart` to run tests.

**Output/Result:**
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/models.py`
-   Modified `gitwrite_api/routers/repository.py`
-   Created `tests/test_api_cherry_pick.py`
-   This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Updated `Implementation_Plan.md` (Task 7.3 marked as Completed).

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 7.4 - Agent_Core_Dev: Beta Reader Workflow (EPUB Export).
