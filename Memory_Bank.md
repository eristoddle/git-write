**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Finalize Refactoring Epic and Plan Next Epic

**Summary:**
The CLI refactoring epic is now complete. All core logic has been successfully moved to the `gitwrite_core` library, and the codebase has been reviewed and cleaned. The project is now ready to begin the next major phase: the development of the REST API.

**Details:**
- **Refactoring Complete:** All tasks in Phases 1 through 4 of the `Implementation_Plan.md` are now marked as "Completed".
- **Next Epic - REST API:** A new "Phase 5: REST API Development" has been added to the `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- **Technical Decisions for API:**
  - **Framework:** FastAPI
  - **Security:** JWT for authentication.
  - **Deployment:** Containerization via Docker for platform-agnostic deployment.
  - **Structure:** A new `gitwrite_api/` directory will be created at the project root and managed by the central `pyproject.toml`, ensuring proper use of the `gitwrite_core` library.
- **Large File Handling:** Acknowledged the risk of large commits over HTTP. The API will implement a two-step upload process (initiate, upload, complete) to handle large files securely and efficiently, preventing API server bottlenecks. This design is reflected in the new tasks for Phase 5.
- The `Implementation_Plan.md` has been updated with a detailed, actionable plan for building the API.

**Output/Result:**
- Updated `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- This log entry.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 5, Task 5.1: Initial API and Docker Setup.
