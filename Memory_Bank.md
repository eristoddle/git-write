**Agent:** Jules (Implementation Agent)
**Task Reference:** Project Planning & Strategy Update

**Summary:**
Completed a major overhaul of the `Implementation_Plan.md` to accurately reflect the project's current state and future goals. The new plan prioritizes achieving feature parity between the REST API and the existing CLI/core functionalities.

**Details:**
- The previous implementation plan was found to be outdated, as it did not account for exposing the full range of features already developed in `gitwrite_core` and the `gitwrite_cli`.
- The entire content of `Implementation_Plan.md` has been replaced with a new, comprehensive plan.
- The new plan introduces "Phase 6: API Feature Parity with CLI" to systematically add endpoints for branching, merging, reverting, syncing, tagging, and ignore management.
- A new "Phase 7: TypeScript SDK Development" has been added and explicitly marked as "On Hold" to clarify that API completion is the immediate priority.
- This strategic update ensures all subsequent work is aligned with the goal of creating a feature-complete API layer before moving on to client-side development.

**Output/Result:**
- Modified file: `Implementation_Plan.md` (content completely replaced)
- This log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Task 6.1: Branching Endpoints as per the new Implementation Plan.
