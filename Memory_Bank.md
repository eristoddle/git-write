**Agent:** Project Manager AI
**Task Reference:** Project Review and Forward Planning

**Summary:**
Conducted a full review of the project state by comparing the `Implementation_Plan.md`, `Memory_Bank.md`, and the `writegit-project-doc.md`. While all tasks in the previous plan are complete, significant features from the project documentation are still missing. The implementation plan has been updated to address these gaps and create a clear path forward.

**Details:**
-   **Analysis:** The project has successfully implemented core functionalities, a CLI, a feature-rich API, and a corresponding SDK. The initial version of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has also been implemented.
-   **Identified Gaps:** Key features from the project documentation remain unimplemented. These include:
    1.  **Advanced Word-by-Word Diff as a Core Feature:** The current word-diff implementation is confined to the CLI's display logic. It needs to be refactored into a reusable core function and exposed via the API to support future web interfaces.
    2.  **Beta Reader Annotation Workflow:** The core logic for receiving, storing, and applying annotations from an EPUB reader is missing. This is a critical part of `FR-006`.
    3.  **Web Application & Mobile Application:** These major frontend components have not been started.
-   **New Plan:** A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated. It marks phases 1-9 as complete and introduces new phases for the remaining work, starting with enhancing the core/API features before tackling the UIs.

**Output/Result:**
-   Generated new `Implementation_Plan.md`.
-   Generated this log entry in `Memory_Bank.md`.
-   Generated the prompt for the next agent session.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with the first task of the new plan: **Task 10.1 - Core Word-by-Word Diff Engine**.
