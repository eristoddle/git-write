**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Project Refactoring Strategy

**Summary:**
Initiating a strategic refactoring of the GitWrite CLI project. The primary goal is to separate the core Git logic from the command-line interface implementation. This will be achieved by creating a new `gitwrite_core` library to house all business logic, making the existing `gitwrite_cli` a thin presentation layer.

**Details:**
- **Problem:** The current project structure in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` tightly couples the core logic (interactions with `pygit2`) with the presentation logic (`click` commands). This is perfectly fine for an MVP but presents challenges for future development, specifically for the planned REST API, which would require duplicating code or creating a messy dependency on the CLI module.
- **Solution:** A new `gitwrite_core` package will be created. All complex logic will be moved into functions within this library. These functions will be designed to be pure and reusable: they will take parameters, perform actions, and either return data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) or raise specific, custom exceptions (e.g., `CommitNotFoundError`).
- **Benefit:** This "Separation of Concerns" will make the code more modular, easier to test, and crucially, allows both the `gitwrite_cli` and the future `gitwrite_api` to use the same robust, tested `gitwrite_core` library without code duplication.
- **Process:** The refactoring will be done incrementally, command by command, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`, to ensure the project remains in a working state throughout the process.

**Output/Result:**
- A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated to guide the refactoring effort.
- This `Memory_Bank.md` entry has been created to log the strategic decision and rationale.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.1 of the new Implementation Plan: setting up the `gitwrite_core` project structure.

**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.1: Project Structure and Core Files Setup

**Summary:**
Completed the setup of the foundational directory structure and files for the `gitwrite_core` library. This is the first step in refactoring the core Git logic out of the CLI.

**Details:**
The following files and directory were created:
- `gitwrite_core/` (directory)
- `gitwrite_core/__init__.py` (file)
- `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` (file with custom exception classes)
- `gitwrite_core/repository.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/branching.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/tagging.py` (file, empty)

**Output/Result:**
The necessary file structure for the `gitwrite_core` library is now in place.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.2, which involves moving the first piece of logic (e.g., repository initialization or status checking) into the new `gitwrite_core` library.

**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.2: Refactor `init` and `ignore` commands
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of `init` and `ignore` commands. Core logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/repository.py`. CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers. Tests were refactored into unit tests for core logic and integration tests for CLI interaction.
**Details:**
 - **`init` command:**
   - Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository(path_str, project_name=None)`.
   - CLI `init` command now calls this core function and handles output.
   - Tests refactored: `TestInitializeRepositoryCore` for unit tests, `TestGitWriteInit` for CLI integration.
 - **`ignore` command (add & list):**
   - Logic for `add` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.add_pattern_to_gitignore(repo_path_str, pattern)`.
   - Logic for `list` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.list_gitignore_patterns(repo_path_str)`.
   - CLI `ignore add` and `ignore list` commands call these core functions.
   - Tests refactored: `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions` for unit tests, existing CLI tests adapted for integration.
**Output/Result:**
 - `gitwrite_core/repository.py` now contains `initialize_repository`, `add_pattern_to_gitignore`, and `list_gitignore_patterns`.
 - `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `init`, `ignore add`, `ignore list` commands are wrappers.
 - `tests/test_main.py` updated with new unit test classes (`TestInitializeRepositoryCore`, `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions`) and refactored CLI tests.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Proceed with Phase 2, Task 2.1: Refactor `tag` Command.
