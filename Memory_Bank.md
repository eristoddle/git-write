## Test Suite Update: XFail Failing Tests

Date: 2025-06-20

The initial targeted fixes for `test_merge_success_normal` (merge state cleanup) and `test_sync_push_failure_non_fast_forward` (initial push to bare repository) did not resolve the test failures.

As per user instruction, the following persistently failing tests have been marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail`:

- `tests/test_core_branching.py::TestMergeBranch::test_merge_success_normal`
- `tests/test_core_repository.py::TestSyncRepositoryCore::test_sync_push_failure_non_fast_forward`

The test suite now reports 199 tests passed and 2 xfailed. Further investigation will be needed to fully resolve the underlying issues for these two tests.

**Agent:** Manager Agent
**Task Reference:** Project Refactoring Strategy

**Summary:**
Initiating a strategic refactoring of the GitWrite CLI project. The primary goal is to separate the core Git logic from the command-line interface implementation. This will be achieved by creating a new `gitwrite_core` library to house all business logic, making the existing `gitwrite_cli` a thin presentation layer.

**Details:**
- **Problem:** The current project structure in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` tightly couples the core logic (interactions with `pygit2`) with the presentation logic (`click` commands). This is perfectly fine for an MVP but presents challenges for future development, specifically for the planned REST API, which would require duplicating code or creating a messy dependency on the CLI module.
- **Solution:** A new `gitwrite_core` package will be created. All complex logic will be moved into functions within this library. These functions will be designed to be pure and reusable: they will take parameters, perform actions, and either return data (e.g., dictionaries, lists) or raise specific, custom exceptions (e.g., `CommitNotFoundError`).
- **Benefit:** This "Separation of Concerns" will make the code more modular, easier to test, and crucially, allows both the `gitwrite_cli` and the future `gitwrite_api` to use the same robust, tested `gitwrite_core` library without code duplication.
- **Process:** The refactoring will be done incrementally, command by command, as outlined in the new `Implementation_Plan.md`, to ensure the project remains in a working state throughout the process.

**Output/Result:**
- A new `Implementation_Plan.md` has been generated to guide the refactoring effort.
- This `Memory_Bank.md` entry has been created to log the strategic decision and rationale.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.1 of the new Implementation Plan: setting up the `gitwrite_core` project structure.

**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.1: Project Structure and Core Files Setup

**Summary:**
Completed the setup of the foundational directory structure and files for the `gitwrite_core` library. This is the first step in refactoring the core Git logic out of the CLI.

**Details:**
The following files and directory were created:
- `gitwrite_core/` (directory)
- `gitwrite_core/__init__.py` (file)
- `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` (file with custom exception classes)
- `gitwrite_core/repository.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/branching.py` (file, empty)
- `gitwrite_core/tagging.py` (file, empty)

**Output/Result:**
The necessary file structure for the `gitwrite_core` library is now in place.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with Phase 1, Task 1.2, which involves moving the first piece of logic (e.g., repository initialization or status checking) into the new `gitwrite_core` library.
---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 1, Task 1.2: Refactor `init` and `ignore` commands
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of `init` and `ignore` commands. Core logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/repository.py`. CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers. Tests were refactored into unit tests for core logic and integration tests for CLI interaction.
**Details:**
 - **`init` command:**
   - Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.initialize_repository(path_str, project_name=None)`.
   - CLI `init` command now calls this core function and handles output.
   - Tests refactored: `TestInitializeRepositoryCore` for unit tests, `TestGitWriteInit` for CLI integration.
 - **`ignore` command (add & list):**
   - Logic for `add` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.add_pattern_to_gitignore(repo_path_str, pattern)`.
   - Logic for `list` moved to `gitwrite_core.repository.list_gitignore_patterns(repo_path_str)`.
   - CLI `ignore add` and `ignore list` commands call these core functions.
   - Tests refactored: `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions` for unit tests, existing CLI tests adapted for integration.
**Output/Result:**
 - `gitwrite_core/repository.py` now contains `initialize_repository`, `add_pattern_to_gitignore`, and `list_gitignore_patterns`.
 - `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `init`, `ignore add`, `ignore list` commands are wrappers.
 - `tests/test_main.py` updated with new unit test classes (`TestInitializeRepositoryCore`, `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions`) and refactored CLI tests.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Proceed with Phase 2, Task 2.1: Refactor `tag` Command.
---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 2, Task 2.1: Refactor `tag` Command
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of the `tag` command. Core logic for creating and listing tags was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/tagging.py`. The CLI `tag add` and `tag list` commands were updated to be thin wrappers around these core functions. Tests were significantly refactored to include comprehensive unit tests for the new core logic and focused integration tests for the CLI.
**Details:**
 - **Core Logic (`gitwrite_core/tagging.py`):**
   - Added `create_tag(repo_path_str, tag_name, target_commit_ish='HEAD', message=None, force=False)`: Handles creation of both lightweight and annotated tags, including force overwrite and error handling (e.g., `TagAlreadyExistsError`, `CommitNotFoundError`). Returns a dictionary with tag details.
   - Added `list_tags(repo_path_str)`: Lists all tags in a repository, returning a list of dictionaries containing tag name, type (lightweight/annotated), target commit OID, and message (for annotated tags).
   - Added `TagAlreadyExistsError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
 - **CLI Updates (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
   - The `tag add` command now calls `gitwrite_core.tagging.create_tag` and handles its output and exceptions.
   - The `tag list` command now calls `gitwrite_core.tagging.list_tags` and uses `rich.Table` to display the returned data.
 - **Test Updates (`tests/test_main.py`):**
   - Added `TestTaggingCore`: A new unit test class with comprehensive tests for `create_tag` and `list_tags`, covering various scenarios and error conditions.
   - Added `TestTagCommandsCLI`: A new integration test class for the `gitwrite tag add` and `gitwrite tag list` CLI commands, ensuring correct interaction with the core library and proper CLI output/error handling.
**Output/Result:**
 - `gitwrite_core/tagging.py` now contains the `create_tag` and `list_tags` functions.
 - `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` includes the new `TagAlreadyExistsError`.
 - `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `tag add` and `tag list` commands are now thin wrappers.
 - `tests/test_main.py` has been updated with new test classes `TestTaggingCore` and `TestTagCommandsCLI` for improved testing of tag functionality.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Proceed with Phase 2, Task 2.2: Refactor `history` and `compare` Commands.
---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 2, Task 2.2: Refactor `history` and `compare` Commands
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of the `history` and `compare` commands. Core logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`. CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers. Unit tests for new core functions and integration tests for CLI commands were added.
**Details:**
    *   **`history` command:**
        *   Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.versioning.get_commit_history(repo_path_str, count=None)`. This function returns a list of dictionaries containing detailed commit information.
        *   CLI `history` command now calls this core function and uses `rich.Table` to display the results.
        *   Added unit tests for `get_commit_history` in `tests/test_core_versioning.py` (class `TestGetCommitHistoryCore`).
        *   Added integration tests for the `history` CLI command in `tests/test_main.py` (class `TestHistoryCommandCLI`).
    *   **`compare` command:**
        *   Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.versioning.get_diff(repo_path_str, ref1_str=None, ref2_str=None)`. This function returns a dictionary with resolved OIDs, display names, and the raw patch text.
        *   Added `NotEnoughHistoryError` to `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py`.
        *   CLI `compare` command calls this core function and remains responsible for word-level diff analysis and `rich` presentation using the returned patch text. A new helper `process_hunk_lines_for_word_diff` was added to `gitwrite_cli/main.py` for this.
        *   Added unit tests for `get_diff` in `tests/test_core_versioning.py` (class `TestGetDiffCore`).
        *   Added integration tests for the `compare` CLI command in `tests/test_main.py` (class `TestCompareCommandCLI`).
**Output/Result:**
    *   `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` now contains `get_commit_history` and `get_diff`.
    *   `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` now includes `NotEnoughHistoryError`.
    *   `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `history` and `compare` commands are now thin wrappers using the core functions. The `compare` command includes a new internal helper `process_hunk_lines_for_word_diff` for Rich output generation from patch text.
    *   `tests/test_core_versioning.py` created with unit tests for the new core versioning functions.
    *   `tests/test_main.py` updated with integration tests for the refactored CLI commands.
**Status:** Completed
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Determine the next task from `Implementation_Plan.md`.

**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 3, Task 3.1 (Partial: explore, switch, merge)
**Summary:** Completed refactoring of `explore`, `switch`, and `merge` commands. Core logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core/branching.py`. CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers. Unit tests for new core functions and integration tests for CLI commands were added/refactored.
**Details:**
- **`explore` command:**
  - Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.branching.create_and_switch_branch(repo_path_str, branch_name)`.
  - CLI `explore` command now calls this core function.
  - Tests: Unit tests for `create_and_switch_branch` added to `tests/test_core_branching.py`. CLI tests in `tests/test_main.py` refactored.
- **`switch` command (list & switch actions):**
  - Listing logic moved to `gitwrite_core.branching.list_branches(repo_path_str)`.
  - Switching logic moved to `gitwrite_core.branching.switch_to_branch(repo_path_str, branch_name)`.
  - CLI `switch` command calls these core functions. `rich.Table` used for list display.
  - Tests: Unit tests for core functions added to `tests/test_core_branching.py`. CLI tests in `tests/test_main.py` refactored.
- **`merge` command:**
  - Logic moved to `gitwrite_core.branching.merge_branch_into_current(repo_path_str, branch_to_merge_name)`.
  - CLI `merge` command calls this core function. Handles various merge outcomes (FF, normal, conflict, up-to-date) based on core function's return.
  - Tests: Unit tests for core function added to `tests/test_core_branching.py`. CLI tests in `tests/test_main.py` refactored.
- **Exceptions Added/Used:**
  - `gitwrite_core.exceptions.BranchAlreadyExistsError`
  - `gitwrite_core.exceptions.RepositoryEmptyError`
  - (Existing exceptions like `RepositoryNotFoundError`, `BranchNotFoundError`, `MergeConflictError`, `GitWriteError` were utilized by new core functions).
**Output/Result:**
- `gitwrite_core/branching.py` now contains `create_and_switch_branch`, `list_branches`, `switch_to_branch`, and `merge_branch_into_current`.
- `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `explore`, `switch`, and `merge` commands are now thin wrappers.
- `tests/test_core_branching.py` created/updated with unit tests for these new core branching functions.
- `tests/test_main.py` updated with refactored/new integration tests for the CLI commands.
**Status:** Partially Completed (for Task 3.1 regarding explore, switch, merge).
**Issues/Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps (Optional):** Refactor `revert` command (Phase 3, Task 3.1 continued) as per `Implementation_Plan.md`.
---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 3, Task 3.1 (continued: Refactor `revert` Command)
**Summary:** The `revert` command was refactored. Core logic was moved to `gitwrite_core/versioning.py`, the CLI command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was updated to be a thin wrapper, and comprehensive unit and integration tests were added. A notable change in the core implementation was the adoption of a manual tree-merging strategy (`repo.merge_trees()`) for performing the revert due to issues with `pygit2.Repository.revert()` in the test environment.
**Details:**
- **Core Logic (`gitwrite_core/versioning.py`):**
    - Added `revert_commit(repo_path_str, commit_ish_to_revert)` function.
    - This function implements the revert operation by:
        1. Identifying the commit to revert and its primary parent.
        2. Using `repo.merge_trees(ancestor_tree, our_tree, their_tree)` to calculate the reverted tree state. (Ancestor is the commit being reverted, "our" is current HEAD, "their" is the parent of the commit being reverted).
        3. If the merge results in conflicts (`index.conflicts is not None`), it aborts the revert, cleans the working directory and index by resetting to the original HEAD, and raises `MergeConflictError`.
        4. If clean, it updates the repository's index and working directory to the reverted state (`repo.index.read_tree()`, `repo.checkout_index()`).
        5. It then creates a new commit reflecting the revert, with a standard revert commit message.
    - Handles `CommitNotFoundError` for invalid commit references and `RepositoryNotFoundError` for invalid repository paths.
- **CLI Updates (`gitwrite_cli/main.py`):**
    - The `revert` command now calls `gitwrite_core.versioning.revert_commit`.
    - It includes a preliminary check for a dirty working directory before calling the core function.
    - It handles success (printing new commit OID) and error conditions (`RepositoryNotFoundError`, `CommitNotFoundError`, `MergeConflictError`, generic `GitWriteError`), providing user-friendly messages.
    - The `--mainline` option was removed from the CLI command, as the new core function defaults to a standard revert behavior (equivalent to mainline 1 for merge commits via the `merge_trees` logic).
- **Test Updates:**
    - Added `TestRevertCommitCore` to `tests/test_core_versioning.py`: Includes unit tests for `revert_commit`, covering clean reverts (regular and merge commits), conflict scenarios (regular and merge commits), commit not found, and non-repository path errors. These tests validate the `merge_trees`-based revert logic.
    - Added `TestRevertCommandCLI` to `tests/test_main.py`: Includes integration tests for the `gitwrite revert` CLI command, ensuring correct interaction with the core library, proper output for success/error, and handling of CLI-specific checks like dirty working directory and non-repository path.
**Output/Result:**
- `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` now contains the refactored `revert_commit` function using the `merge_trees` strategy.
- The `revert` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` is a thin wrapper around the core function.
- `tests/test_core_versioning.py` and `tests/test_main.py` have new, comprehensive test suites for the `revert` functionality, all passing.
**Status:** Completed (for the `revert` part of Task 3.1).
**Issues/Blockers:** Encountered a persistent `AttributeError` with `pygit2.Repository.revert()` in the test environment, which necessitated the change to a manual `merge_trees`-based implementation in the core logic. This workaround proved successful.
**Next Steps (Optional):** With the `revert` command refactoring complete, Phase 3, Task 3.1 is now fully completed. The next task is Phase 3, Task 3.2: Refactor `save` and `sync` Commands.
---
**Agent:** Jules
**Task Reference:** Implementation Plan: Core Logic Refactoring, Phase 3, Task 3.2: Refactor `save` and `sync` Commands
**Summary:** Completed the refactoring of the `save` and `sync` commands. Core Git logic was moved from `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to new functions in `gitwrite_core` (`versioning.py` for `save`, `repository.py` for `sync`). The CLI commands were updated to be thin wrappers around these core functions. Comprehensive unit tests for the new core logic and integration tests for the CLI interactions were added and/or refactored.

**Details for `save` refactor:**
- **Core function:** `gitwrite_core.versioning.save_changes(repo_path_str, message, include_paths=None)`
- **Key responsibilities of the core function:** Handles staging of changes (all or specified paths), commit object creation, and finalizing special operations like merges (clearing `MERGE_HEAD`) or reverts (clearing `REVERT_HEAD`, formatting commit message). It determines parent commits correctly for initial, normal, merge, and revert commits.
- **New exceptions:** `NoChangesToSaveError`, `RevertConflictError` (added to `gitwrite_core.exceptions.py`).

**Details for `sync` refactor:**
- **Core function:** `gitwrite_core.repository.sync_repository(repo_path_str, remote_name="origin", branch_name_opt=None, push=True, allow_no_push=False)`
- **Key responsibilities of the core function:** Manages the entire synchronization process including:
    - Fetching changes from the remote.
    - Analyzing local vs. remote state (up-to-date, ahead, behind, diverged).
    - Performing local updates: fast-forwarding or merging (with conflict detection and resolution advisory).
    - Pushing changes to the remote if enabled and applicable.
- **New exceptions:** `DetachedHeadError`, `FetchError`, `PushError` (added to `gitwrite_core.exceptions.py`). `RemoteNotFoundError` was also added as it was missing.
- **CLI Update:** The `gitwrite sync` CLI command now includes a `--no-push` flag to control the push behavior of the core function.

**Output/Result:**
- `gitwrite_core/versioning.py` now contains `save_changes`.
- `gitwrite_core/repository.py` now contains `sync_repository`.
- `gitwrite_core/exceptions.py` updated with the new exceptions.
- `gitwrite_cli/main.py` `save` and `sync` commands are now thin wrappers. The `sync` command has a new `--no-push` option.
- `tests/test_core_versioning.py` includes new unit tests for `save_changes`.
- `tests/test_core_repository.py` created with new unit tests for `sync_repository`.
- `tests/test_main.py` CLI integration tests for `save` and `sync` were refactored and expanded.

**Status:** Completed.

**Issues/Blockers:**
- During the implementation of `sync` CLI tests, some `revert` CLI tests in `tests/test_main.py` were accidentally removed due to an overly broad search pattern in the `replace_with_git_merge_diff` tool. This needs to be addressed in a separate action to restore the `revert` CLI tests. The focus of this task was solely the `save` and `sync` command refactoring and testing, which was successful.

**Next Steps:** Update `Implementation_Plan.md`.

## Test Suite Fixes - `tests/test_core_repository.py`

**Agent:** Jules
**Task Reference:** Fix test failures in `tests/test_core_repository.py` after `_make_commit` refactoring.

**Summary:**
A significant number of test failures (initially 17) arose in `tests/test_core_repository.py` after the `sync_repository` function was added and its associated test suite was created. These failures were primarily traced back to the test helper function `_make_commit` within `tests/test_core_repository.py` itself, which was also used by many tests for `sync_repository`.

**Problem with `_make_commit`:**
The original `_make_commit` test helper had flawed logic for handling branch creation and switching. It would attempt to switch branches by calling `repo.set_head(ref_name)` without an accompanying `repo.checkout()` to update the working directory and index. This led to inconsistencies in the repository state, causing many tests that relied on this helper for setting up specific Git scenarios to fail.

**Solution:**
1.  **Refactor `_make_commit`:** The problematic `_make_commit` was refactored into three more focused and correctly implemented helper functions:
    *   `_create_branch(self, repo: pygit2.Repository, branch_name: str, from_commit: pygit2.Commit)`: Handles only branch creation.
    *   `_checkout_branch(self, repo: pygit2.Repository, branch_name: str)`: Handles branch checkout, including updating HEAD and working directory.
    *   A new, simplified `_make_commit(self, repo: pygit2.Repository, filename: str, content: str, message: str) -> pygit2.Oid`: This version now only creates a commit on the *currently checked-out* branch. It no longer attempts any branch switching.

2.  **Update Test Methods:** All test methods in `tests/test_core_repository.py` that previously used the old `_make_commit` with a `branch_name` parameter were updated to use the new set of helpers explicitly:
    *   To create/commit to a new branch: First call `_make_commit` (if it's the first commit on HEAD), then `_create_branch`, then `_checkout_branch`. Or, `_create_branch` from an existing commit, `_checkout_branch`, then `_make_commit`.
    *   To commit to an existing branch: Explicitly call `_checkout_branch` first, then `_make_commit`.

**Outcome:**
This refactoring of the test helpers and the subsequent updates to the test methods resolved the vast majority of the test failures. After these changes and further iterative debugging of specific test logic (related to bare repository setups, mock paths, and state assertions), 16 out of 17 tests in `tests/test_core_repository.py` are now believed to be passing. One test, `test_sync_push_failure_non_fast_forward`, still has issues related to reliably setting up its initial state on a bare remote repository.

**Status:** Mostly Completed (16/17 tests fixed).

## Test Suite Refactoring - 2024-10-27

- Major refactoring of the test suite was performed.
- The monolithic `tests/test_main.py` file was split into multiple smaller, focused test files under the `tests/` directory:
    - `test_cli_init_ignore.py`
    - `test_cli_save_revert.py`
    - `test_cli_sync_merge.py`
    - `test_cli_history_compare.py`
    - `test_cli_explore_switch.py`
    - `test_cli_tag.py`
- Obsolete test classes (`TestGitWriteSaveSelectiveStaging`, `TestInitializeRepositoryCore`, `TestIgnoreCoreFunctions`, `TestTaggingCore`) were removed from `tests/test_main.py`.
- Relevant CLI test classes were moved from `tests/test_main.py` and `tests/test_tag_command.py` to the new files.
- Tests were updated to align with the new core logic:
    - Revert command tests now expect errors for direct merge reverts (instead of using `--mainline`).
    - Save command tests now assert the cleanup of `MERGE_HEAD` and `REVERT_HEAD` after successful operations.
    - Sync/Merge conflict tests now verify CLI messages and conflict markers, expecting a clean repository state post-operation.
- The original `tests/test_main.py` and `tests/test_tag_command.py` files were deleted.
- **Note:** Execution of `poetry run pytest tests/` failed due to an environment/tooling issue ('Failed to compute affected file count and total size after command execution'), so complete test verification was not possible during this refactoring process.
---
## Task: Fix Test Suite by Centralizing Fixtures

**Date:** 2025-06-19

**Summary:** Created `tests/conftest.py` and centralized all shared test fixtures from individual test files (`tests/test_*.py`) into this new file. This was done to resolve "fixture not found" errors that were occurring due to fixtures not being shared across the test suite. Helper functions used by these fixtures were also moved and consolidated where appropriate. Necessary imports were added to `tests/conftest.py`, and redundant imports and fixture definitions were removed from the individual test files.

**Note:** Test execution to confirm the resolution of "fixture not found" errors was blocked by a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygit2'` in the testing environment.
---
## Project Structure Refactoring - Pyproject and Poetry Configuration

**Agent:** Jules (via Manager instruction)
**Task Reference:** Monorepo Restructuring - `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.toml` relocation.

**Summary:**
Refactored the project structure by moving `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.toml` from the `gitwrite_cli` subdirectory to the project root. The root `pyproject.toml` configuration was then updated to correctly define both `gitwrite_cli` and `gitwrite_core` as distinct packages within the Poetry project. This change standardizes the project layout, making it a more conventional monorepo structure managed by Poetry, and resolves previous issues related to package discovery, installation, and module resolution that arose from the nested configuration. `poetry install` was run successfully after these changes, confirming the new setup.

**Details:**
- `gitwrite_cli/pyproject.toml` was moved to `./pyproject.toml`.
- `gitwrite_cli/poetry.toml` was moved to `./poetry.toml`.
- The `[tool.poetry.packages]` section in the root `./pyproject.toml` was updated to:
  ```toml
  [tool.poetry]
  packages = [
      { include = "gitwrite_cli" },
      { include = "gitwrite_core" },
  ]
  ```
- `poetry install` was executed in the project root, which successfully created a virtual environment (`.venv/`) and installed all dependencies, including the `gitwrite_cli` and `gitwrite_core` packages in editable mode.

**Output/Result:**
- Project now has a root `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.toml`.
- Poetry correctly recognizes and manages `gitwrite_cli` and `gitwrite_core` as packages.
- Development environment is correctly set up for further work on both packages.

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
Encountered significant difficulties with file modification tools (`overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, `delete_file`) when attempting to modify or delete files in the root directory, particularly `./pyproject.toml`, after they had been moved there. These tools often reported files as not existing when `ls` confirmed they did, or patches failed to apply.
Workaround:
  1. Resetting the repository (`reset_all()`).
  2. Modifying `pyproject.toml` *within* the `gitwrite_cli` directory to its final desired content.
  3. Using `run_in_bash_session` with `rm` to delete any conflicting file at the root if `rename_file` reported a conflict.
  4. Moving the pre-modified `pyproject.toml` from `gitwrite_cli/` to the root.
This sequence of operations proved more reliable.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
Proceed with any further development tasks, now that the project structure and Poetry configuration are stable.
---
Fixed widespread `NameError` test failures by adding the necessary helper function imports from `conftest.py` to the relevant test files:
- `tests/test_cli_history_compare.py`
- `tests/test_cli_init_ignore.py`
- `tests/test_cli_save_revert.py`
- `tests/test_cli_sync_merge.py`
- `tests/test_core_branching.py`
