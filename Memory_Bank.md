**Agent:** Manager Agent (Jules)
**Task Reference:** Project State Summary - CLI MVP

**Summary:**
The GitWrite CLI MVP development has progressed through the implementation of core features including `init`, `save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, and `revert`. Testing for `revert` and `init` is complete. A bug in `init` was found and fixed. A reported `sync` typo was investigated and found to be likely already resolved.

**Details:**
- **Implemented Commands:**
    - `gitwrite init [project_name]`: Initializes project structure.
    - `gitwrite save "message"`: Stages changes and commits; handles merge and revert commit finalization.
    - `gitwrite history [-n count]`: Displays formatted commit history.
    - `gitwrite explore <branch_name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
    - `gitwrite switch [<branch_name>]`: Switches to an existing branch or lists branches.
    - `gitwrite merge <branch_name>`: Merges branches, handling fast-forwards, normal merges, and conflicts (manual resolution + `gitwrite save`).
    - `gitwrite compare [ref1] [ref2]`: Displays word-level diff.
    - `gitwrite sync [--remote <remote>] [--branch <branch>]`: Fetches, pulls/merges, and pushes changes.
    - `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]`: Reverts specified commit (non-merge commits fully supported; merge commits have limitations).
- **Code Committed:**
    - Features up to `sync` were on `cli-mvp-features`.
    - The `revert` command and its tests were developed on the `feature/revert-command` branch.
    - `init` command tests and a related bugfix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` are part of the current work.

**Output/Result:**
- **Committed Code:** Branch `feature/revert-command` contains the `revert` feature. Other features are on `cli-mvp-features` or merged to main. Recent `init` tests and fixes are pending commit/merge.
- **Known Typo:** In `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (sync command) - **INVESTIGATED**: Typo `paciente=True` not found; likely already fixed or misreported.
- **Identified Limitation:** `gitwrite revert` cannot perform index-only reverts of merge commits with specific mainline parent selection due to underlying `pygit2.Repository.revert()` behavior in v1.18.0; CLI now errors gracefully for this case.
- **Bug Fix (init):** Corrected `repo.status_file()` call in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` to use relative path for `.gitignore`, fixing an idempotency issue.

**Status:** Testing and Refinement in Progress

**Issues/Blockers (Current):**
- No major environment blockers.

**Completed Original Plan Items (Previously Blocked):**
- Step 8: Implement `gitwrite revert` - **DONE** (with noted limitations for merge commits)
- Step 9: Develop Unit and Integration Tests (for `revert`) - **DONE**

**Remaining Original Plan Items (Adjusted):**
- Comprehensive testing for *all* CLI commands. (`init` and `revert` commands now have good test coverage).
- Address `sync` command typo. - **DONE** (Investigated, typo not found, likely already fixed or misreported).
- Step 10: Create User Documentation.
- Step 11: Refine CLI and Address Issues (e.g., review `revert` merge limitations for future improvement if library changes; bug in `init` regarding `status_file` path was fixed).
- Step 12: Update `Memory_Bank.md` file - This log entry. (Ongoing)
- Step 13: Add Memory Bank and Handover Protocol notes to `Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Step 14: Finalize the initial CLI application.

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- **Your Action:**
    - Review and merge `feature/revert-command` (if not already done).
    - Prioritize next development tasks:
        - Continue comprehensive testing for other CLI commands (`save`, `history`, `explore`, `switch`, `merge`, `compare`, `sync`, `tag`, `ignore`).
        - Begin work on User Documentation (Step 10).
- **My Action:** Awaiting your guidance.

**Update: `init` Command Testing, `sync` Typo Investigation, and `init` Bug Fix**

This update covers the investigation of a reported typo in the `sync` command, the successful implementation of comprehensive tests for the `gitwrite init` command, and a bug fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` that was discovered during this testing phase.

**1. `sync` Command Typo (`paciente=True`) Investigation:**
-   A thorough review of the `gitwrite_cli/main.py` file, specifically the `sync` command, was conducted. This included manual code inspection and `grep` searches for the term "paciente".
-   **Conclusion:** The reported typo `paciente=True` was **not found** in the codebase.
    -   All `click.echo` statements within the `sync` command correctly use `err=True` for error messages intended for `stderr`, or no `err` parameter (which defaults to `err=False`, i.e., `stdout`) for standard informational messages.
    -   It is presumed that the typo was either fixed in a previous, unlogged commit or the initial report was inaccurate regarding the parameter name or its existence.
    -   This item is now considered closed.

**2. `gitwrite init` Command Testing:**
-   A new test class, `TestGitWriteInit`, was added to `tests/test_main.py` to provide comprehensive test coverage for the `gitwrite init` command.
-   **Key Scenarios Tested and Passing (8 tests in total):**
    -   Successful initialization in an empty current directory (when no project name is provided).
    -   Successful initialization when a `project_name` is specified (creating the project directory).
    -   Correct creation of the standard GitWrite project structure: `drafts/`, `notes/` directories, `metadata.yml` file, and `.gitkeep` files within `drafts/` and `notes/`.
    -   Generation of a `.gitignore` file with common Python and IDE ignore patterns.
    -   Verification of the initial commit: correct commit message, author details (GitWrite System), and presence of core structure files in the commit tree.
    -   Error handling for invalid target names:
        -   When the specified `project_name` already exists as a file.
        -   When the `project_name` directory exists, is not empty, and is not a Git repository.
    -   Correct behavior when `init` is run in an existing Git repository (i.e., adds GitWrite structure and files, creates a new commit, but does not re-initialize the `.git` directory).
    -   Error handling when `init` is run in a non-empty current directory that is not a Git repository (and no project name is given).
    -   Verification that `init` correctly appends GitWrite-specific patterns to a pre-existing `.gitignore` file, preserving user's custom entries.
    -   Idempotency: ensuring that running `init` multiple times in an already correctly initialized GitWrite directory does not create redundant new commits.
-   All tests for `TestGitWriteInit` are currently passing.

**3. Bug Fix in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` (related to `init` command):**
-   **Discovery:** During the development of the idempotency test for `gitwrite init` (`test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure`), a bug was uncovered. When `init` was run a second time in an already initialized directory, an unexpected `KeyError` related to `.gitignore` would occur.
-   **Root Cause:** The `init` command in `gitwrite_cli/main.py` was calling `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))`. The function `repo.status_file()` expects a path relative to the repository's working directory, but `str(gitignore_file)` was providing an absolute path. This caused `pygit2` to raise a `KeyError` when it couldn't find the absolute path in its internal representation of the working tree.
-   **Fix:** The call was changed from `repo.status_file(str(gitignore_file))` to `repo.status_file(gitignore_file.name)`. Since `gitignore_file` is defined as `target_dir / ".gitignore"`, `gitignore_file.name` correctly provides the relative filename `".gitignore"`.
-   This fix allowed the `test_init_is_idempotent_for_structure` to pass and ensures more robust behavior for the `init` command.

**Update: `gitwrite revert` Implementation and Testing**

The `gitwrite revert <commit_ref> [--mainline <parent_num>]` command has been successfully implemented and tested.

**Key Features & Details:**
-   **Non-Merge Commits:** Successfully reverts non-merge commits. A new commit is created with a standard message format (e.g., "Revert '[original commit message]'"), and the working directory reflects the undone changes.
-   **Conflict Handling:** If a revert attempt results in conflicts, the command updates the index with conflict markers and creates `REVERT_HEAD`. It then instructs the user to manually resolve the conflicts and use `gitwrite save "message"` to complete the revert.
-   **`gitwrite save` Enhancement:** The `save` command was updated to detect the presence of `REVERT_HEAD`. If found, it automatically prepends the standard "Revert '[original commit message]'" to the user's provided save message, ensuring clear commit history for resolved reverts. It also correctly cleans up `REVERT_HEAD` (and `MERGE_HEAD` if applicable) via `repo.state_cleanup()`.
-   **Merge Commit Reverts (Limitation Identified):**
    *   During development, it was discovered that `pygit2.Repository.revert()` (version 1.18.0, as installed in the environment) does not reliably support specifying a mainline parent for merge commits when the goal is to *only update the index* (as opposed to directly creating the revert commit). Attempts to pass `mainline` as a keyword or positional argument led to various `TypeError` or specific errors from `libgit2` (e.g., "mainline branch is not specified..."). `RevertOptions` was also found to be not directly importable from `pygit2` in this version.
    *   Consequently, the `gitwrite revert` command now detects if the target commit is a merge commit. If so, it informs the user that this specific operation (index-only revert of a merge commit, especially with mainline selection) is not supported with the current underlying library method and fails gracefully with an error message. The `--mainline` option is therefore only relevant for informational purposes if a future `pygit2` version or method allows it.
-   **Testing:**
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `revert` command were added to `tests/test_main.py`.
    *   Scenarios covered include: successful non-merge reverts, reverting an initial commit, reverting a revert commit, attempts to revert with a dirty working directory, invalid commit references, and handling of conflicts (including resolution via `gitwrite save`).
    *   The merge commit revert test was updated to assert that the CLI now correctly identifies merge commits and informs the user of the current limitation.
    *   All 12 tests in the suite are currently passing.
-   **Dependencies:** Python package dependencies (`click`, `pygit2==1.18.0`, `rich`, `pytest`) were installed and utilized during development and testing.

This work effectively completes the `revert` command implementation as per the original plan, within the constraints discovered with the `pygit2` library.
