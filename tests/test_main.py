    # This is hard to do reliably without parsing Rich's specific output format.
    # For now, the presence of both lines with +/- and the filename is a reasonable check.
    # The prompt also suggested "[-original-]{+significantly changed+}" - this depends on difflib's direct output
    # and how it's rendered. If the CLI formats it this way, we can check for it.
    # The current implementation uses Rich's Text.stylize for word diffs,
    # which would result in ANSI codes, not this literal format in plain text output.
