# Note on Auth Mocking:
# The mocking of `get_current_active_user` and `require_role` is crucial.
# `app.dependency_overrides[ActualDependency]` is the standard FastAPI way.
# Using MagicMock(name="...") is a workaround if the actual dependency object is hard to import directly
# or if you want to avoid direct import coupling in tests.
# The most robust way is `from gitwrite_api.security import get_current_active_user, require_role`
# and then `app.dependency_overrides[get_current_active_user] = ...`
# The current `@patch` approach on the router's imported names is also valid for mocking core calls.
# The `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` for `override_auth_dependencies` tries to set a baseline,
# but specific tests like role checks might need more careful, localized overrides.
# The test `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` attempts this, showing complexity.
# A simpler pattern for auth per test:
# with client.app.dependency_overrides as overrides:
#     overrides[get_current_active_user] = lambda: specific_user_for_this_test
#     response = client.get(...)

# For `require_role`, since it's a dependency that itself calls `get_current_active_user`,
# mocking `get_current_active_user` to return a user with specific roles is often sufficient
# to test `require_role`'s behavior indirectly.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` aims to test this.
# It's important that the `Depends(require_role([...]))` in the endpoint signature correctly
# picks up the mocked `get_current_active_user`.
# The global `autouse=True` fixture setting `app.dependency_overrides[MagicMock(name="require_role")]`
# might interfere if not carefully managed. It was removed from the global fixture to simplify.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` was updated to reflect a more common way of testing this.
# (By ensuring the user passed to the real `require_role` via `get_current_active_user` mock causes a 403).

# Correcting the mock override within the test:
# The fixture `mock_active_user` is already a WRITER. `mock_active_editor_user` is EDITOR.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` should use `mock_active_user` for the `get_current_active_user` override.
# The global `override_auth_dependencies` fixture was simplified.
# The `get_auth_headers` is mostly symbolic when auth is mocked this way.

# Final check on the forbidden test:
# `app.dependency_overrides[get_current_active_user] = lambda: mock_active_user` (WRITER)
# The PUT endpoint requires EDITOR or OWNER. So, this should result in 403.
# This seems correct if `require_role` uses the overridden `get_current_active_user`.
# This is standard FastAPI behavior for nested dependencies.
# The `MagicMock(name=...)` for overriding was problematic. Let's ensure direct dependency overriding.
# We will rely on specific overrides in tests needing different users/roles than the default fixture.
# The `autouse=True` override_auth_dependencies was simplified and specific overrides are shown in tests.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` was simplified to rely on a fixture providing a user
# that would be forbidden by the actual `require_role` logic.
# The key is that `app.dependency_overrides` correctly targets the *actual* dependency function used in `Depends()`.
# If `from ..security import get_current_active_user` is used in router, then `app.dependency_overrides[get_current_active_user]` is the way.
# The `MagicMock(name=...)` approach is less reliable. Assuming direct imports in routers.
# The `override_auth_dependencies` fixture needs to correctly target these.
# For now, the tests rely on `app.dependency_overrides` being set correctly for `get_current_active_user`
# and `require_role` functioning with this mocked user.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` shows one way to test this.
# The global autouse fixture for overriding auth was removed to make per-test overrides clearer. Each test requiring auth
# will now need to explicitly set `app.dependency_overrides` or use a fixture that does so.
# The provided solution structure assumes that `get_current_active_user` is the primary dependency to mock for auth.
# The `require_role` then consumes this.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` was updated to use `app.dependency_overrides` within the test.
# And `get_auth_headers` is kept for completeness, though not strictly necessary with these mocks.
# The fixture `override_auth_dependencies` was removed to favor explicit per-test setup for clarity.
# Instead, individual tests now set their required user.
# The `mock_active_user` and `mock_active_editor_user` are just user data fixtures now.
# The test `test_create_annotation_success` etc. show how to set the override.
# The forbidden test also explicitly sets its user.

# Re-evaluating the fixture strategy for auth:
# It's often cleaner to have a fixture that handles the override and cleanup.

    else:
        del app.dependency_overrides[actual_get_user_dep]

# Now tests can use @pytest.mark.parametrize("mock_auth", ["mock_active_user"], indirect=True)
# or just @pytest.mark.usefixtures("mock_auth") if they don't need the user object directly
# and the default user from mock_auth is fine.

# The tests will be rewritten slightly to use this new `mock_auth` fixture.
# This makes auth setup cleaner per test.
# The `get_auth_headers` remains mostly symbolic.
# The `test_update_annotation_status_forbidden_for_writer` will use `mock_auth` parameterized with `mock_active_user`.
# The other tests will use `mock_auth` parameterized appropriately or use its default.

# Let's simplify and assume direct dependency imports are mockable.
# The test structure below is based on patching the core functions and
# providing a mock user for the auth layer.
# The `override_auth_dependencies` fixture was removed. Tests will set up their own auth context.
# This makes each test more explicit about its auth requirements.
# The `mock_active_user` and `mock_active_editor_user` are used to provide user objects.
# The `client.app.dependency_overrides` context manager is the cleanest way.

# Final structure for tests:
# - Each test uses `client.app.dependency_overrides` context manager for auth.
# - Core calls are mocked using `@patch`.
# - `PLACEHOLDER_REPO_PATH` from the router module is used for assertions.
# - `get_auth_headers` is symbolic and could be removed if tests don't need it.
# - This provides clear, per-test setup for dependencies.
# I will proceed with creating the file with this refined structure.Tool output for `create_file_with_block`:
